DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggddiiffffmmkk compares two ggrrooffff(1), nnrrooffff(1), or ttrrooffff(1)  documents,  _f_i_l_e_1
       and  _f_i_l_e_2,  and  creates  an  output which is _f_i_l_e_2 with added "margin
       character" (.mc) commands that indicate the differences.

       If the _o_u_t_p_u_t filename is present, the output is written there.  If  it
       is -- or absent the output is written to the standard output.

       If the _f_i_l_e_1 or _f_i_l_e_2 argument is -- the standard input is read for that
       input.  Clearly both cannot be --.

       Note that the output is not necessarily compatible with all macro pack-
       ages and all preprocessors.  See section "Bugs" below.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa_a_d_d_m_a_r_k
              Use  the  _a_d_d_m_a_r_k  for  source lines not in _f_i_l_e_1 but present in
              _f_i_l_e_2.  Default: ++.

       --BB     By default, the deleted texts marked by the --DD option  end  with
              an  added troff break command, ..bbrr, to ensure that the deletions
              are marked properly.  This is the only  way  to  guarantee  that
              deletions  and  small  changes get flagged.  This option directs
              the program not to insert these breaks; it makes no sense to use
              it without --DD.

       --cc_c_h_a_n_g_e_m_a_r_k
              Use the _c_h_a_n_g_e_m_a_r_k for changed source lines.  Default: ||.

       --dd_d_e_l_e_t_e_m_a_r_k
              Use the _d_e_l_e_t_e_m_a_r_k for deleted source lines.  Default: **.

       --DD     Show  the  deleted  portions  from  changed  and  deleted  text.
              Default delimiting marks: [[[[ ... ]]]].

       --MM_m_a_r_k_1 _m_a_r_k_2
              Change the delimiting marks for the  --DD  option.   It  makes  no
              sense to use this option without --DD.

       --xx_d_i_f_f_c_m_d
              Use  the  _d_i_f_f_c_m_d command to perform the comparison of _f_i_l_e_1 and
              _f_i_l_e_2.  In particular, _d_i_f_f_c_m_d should accept the GNU ddiiffff --DD_n_a_m_e
              option.  Default: ddiiffff(1).

       ----     All  the  following arguments are treated as file names, even if
              they begin with --.

       ----hheellpp Print a usage message on standard error output and exit.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information on the standard output and exit.

BBUUGGSS
       The output is not necessarily compatible with all  macro  packages  and
       all  preprocessors.  A workaround that is often successful against pre-
       processor problems is to run ggddiiffffmmkk on the  output  of  all  the  pre-
       processors instead of the input source.

       ggddiiffffmmkk  relies  on  the  --DD_n_a_m_e option of GNU ddiiffff(1) to make a merged
       "#ifdef" output format.  It hasn't been tested whether  other  versions
       of ddiiffff(1) do support this option.  See also the --xx_d_i_f_f_c_m_d option.
