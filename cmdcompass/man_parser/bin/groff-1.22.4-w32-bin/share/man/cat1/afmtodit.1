DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t creates a font file for use with  _g_r_o_f_f,  _g_r_o_p_s,  and  _g_r_o_p_d_f.
       _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t  is written in Perl; you must have Perl version 5.004 or newer
       installed in order to run _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t.

       _a_f_m_-_f_i_l_e is the AFM (Adobe Font Metric) file for the font.

       _m_a_p_-_f_i_l_e is a file that says which _g_r_o_f_f character names map onto  each
       PostScript character name; this file should contain a sequence of lines
       of the form
              _p_s_-_c_h_a_r _g_r_o_f_f_-_c_h_a_r
       where _p_s_-_c_h_a_r is the PostScript name of the character and _g_r_o_f_f_-_c_h_a_r is
       the  groff name of the character (as used in the _g_r_o_f_f font file).  The
       same _p_s_-_c_h_a_r can occur multiple times in the file; each _g_r_o_f_f_-_c_h_a_r must
       occur  at  most  once.   Lines  starting  with  `#' and blank lines are
       ignored.  If the file isn't found  in  the  current  directory,  it  is
       searched  for  in  the  _d_e_v_p_s_/_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e subdirectory of the default font
       directory.

       If a PostScript character is not mentioned in _m_a_p_-_f_i_l_e, and  a  generic
       _g_r_o_f_f  glyph  name  can't  be  deduced using the Adobe Glyph List (AGL,
       built into _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t), then _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t puts the PostScript character  into
       the  _g_r_o_f_f font file as an unnamed character which can only be accessed
       by the `\N' escape sequence in a _r_o_f_f document.  In particular, this is
       true  for  glyph  variants named in the form "foo.bar"; all glyph names
       containing one or more periods are  mapped  to  unnamed  entities.   If
       option --ee is not specified, the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e.,
       entries with non-negative character codes) is used.  Refer  to  section
       "Using  Symbols"  in  _G_r_o_f_f_: _T_h_e _G_N_U _I_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n _o_f _t_r_o_f_f, the _g_r_o_f_f
       Texinfo manual, which describes how _g_r_o_f_f glyph names are constructed.

       Characters not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries which  have  `-1'
       as  the  character  code)  are still available in _g_r_o_f_f; they get glyph
       index values greater than 255 (or greater than  the  biggest  character
       code  used in the AFM file in the unlikely case that it is greater than
       255) in the _g_r_o_f_f font file.  Glyph  indices  of  unencoded  characters
       don't have a specific order; it is best to access them with glyph names
       only.

       The _g_r_o_f_f font file will be output to a file called _f_o_n_t, unless the --oo
       option is used.

       If  there is a downloadable font file for the font, it may be listed in
       the file _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_f_o_n_t_/_d_e_v_p_s_/_d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d; see _g_r_o_p_s(1).

       If the --ii option is  used,  _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t  will  automatically  generate  an
       italic  correction, a left italic correction and a subscript correction
       for each character (the significance of these parameters  is  explained
       in  _g_r_o_f_f___f_o_n_t(5));  these  parameters  may be specified for individual
       characters by adding to the _a_f_m_-_f_i_l_e lines of the form:
              iittaalliiccCCoorrrreeccttiioonn _p_s_-_c_h_a_r _n
              lleeffttIIttaalliiccCCoorrrreeccttiioonn _p_s_-_c_h_a_r _n
              ssuubbssccrriippttCCoorrrreeccttiioonn _p_s_-_c_h_a_r _n
       where _p_s_-_c_h_a_r is the PostScript name of the character,  and  _n  is  the
       desired  value  of the corresponding parameter in thousandths of an em.
       These parameters are normally  needed  only  for  italic  (or  oblique)
       fonts.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --aa_n    Use  _n  as the slant parameter in the font file; this is used by
              _g_r_o_f_f in the positioning of accents.  By default  _a_f_m_t_o_d_i_t  uses
              the  negative of the IIttaalliiccAAnnggllee specified in the AFM file; with
              true italic fonts it is sometimes desirable to use a slant  that
              is  less  than this.  If you find that characters from an italic
              font have accents placed too far to the right  over  them,  then
              use the --aa option to give the font a smaller slant.

       --cc     Include comments in the font file in order to identify the Post-
              Script font.

       --dd_d_e_s_c_-_f_i_l_e
              The device description file is _d_e_s_c_-_f_i_l_e rather than the default
              _D_E_S_C.   If  not found in the current directory, the _d_e_v_p_s subdi-
              rectory of the default font directory is searched (this is  true
              for  both  the  default device description file and a file given
              with option --dd).

       --ee_e_n_c_-_f_i_l_e
              The PostScript font should be  reencoded  to  use  the  encoding
              described  in  _e_n_c_-_f_i_l_e.  The format of _e_n_c_-_f_i_l_e is described in
              _g_r_o_p_s(1).  If not found in the current directory, the _d_e_v_p_s sub-
              directory of the default font directory is searched.

       --ff_n_a_m_e The internal name of the _g_r_o_f_f font is set to _n_a_m_e.

       --ii_n    Generate  an  italic  correction  for each character so that the
              character's width plus  the  character's  italic  correction  is
              equal  to  _n  thousandths  of an em plus the amount by which the
              right edge of the character's bounding box is to  the  right  of
              the  character's  origin.   If  this  would result in a negative
              italic correction, use a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x-height
              of the font.  If this would result  in  a  subscript  correction
              greater  than  the italic correction, use a subscript correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also generate a left italic correction for each character  equal
              to _n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left edge
              of the character's bounding box is to the left  of  the  charac-
              ter's origin.  The left italic correction may be negative unless
              option --mm is given.

              This option is normally needed only  with  italic  (or  oblique)
              fonts.  The font files distributed with _g_r_o_f_f were created using
              an option of --ii5500 for italic fonts.

       --oo_o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_i_l_e
              The output file is _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_i_l_e instead of _f_o_n_t.

       --kk     Omit any  kerning  data  from  the  _g_r_o_f_f  font;  use  only  for
              monospaced (constant-width) fonts.

       --mm     Prevent  negative  left  italic  correction  values.  Roman font
              files distributed with _g_r_o_f_f were created with --ii00 --mm to improve
              spacing with _e_q_n(1).

       --nn     Don't  output  a  lliiggaattuurreess  command  for  this  font;  use with
              monospaced (constant-width) fonts.

       --ss     The font is special.  The effect of this option is  to  add  the
              ssppeecciiaall command to the font file.

       --vv     Print version and exit.

       --xx     Don't use the built-in Adobe Glyph List.
