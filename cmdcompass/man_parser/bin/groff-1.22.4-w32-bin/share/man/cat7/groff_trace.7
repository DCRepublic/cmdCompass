       The  _t_r_a_c_e  macro package of ggrrooffff(1) can be a valuable tool for debug-
       ging documents written in the roff formatting language.  A  call  stack
       trace  is  protocolled on standard error, this is, a diagnostic message
       is emitted on entering and exiting of a macro call.  This greatly eases
       to track down an error in some macro.

       This tracing process is activated by specifying the groff or troff com-
       mand-line option --mm ttrraaccee.  This works also with the ggrrooffffeerr(1)  viewer
       program.   A  finer control can be obtained by including the macro file
       within the document by the  groff  macro  call  ..mmssoo ttrraaccee..ttmmaacc.   Only
       macros that are defined after this line are traced.

       If  the command-line option --rr ttrraaccee--ffuullll==11 is given (or if this regis-
       ter is set in the document), number and string register assignments to-
       gether with some other requests are traced also.

       If  some other macro package should be traced as well it must be speci-
       fied after --mm ttrraaccee on the command line.

       The macro file ttrraaccee..ttmmaacc is unusual because it does  not  contain  any
       macros  to be called by a user.  Instead, the existing macro definition
       and appending facilities are modified such that they display diagnostic
       messages.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       In  the following examples, a roff fragment is fed into groff via stan-
       dard input.  As we are  only  interested  in  the  diagnostic  messages
       (standard error) on the terminal, the normal formatted output (standard
       output) is redirected to the nirvana device _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.   The  resulting
       diagnostic  messages are displayed directly below the corresponding ex-
       ample.

       Example:

              _s_h_# echo '.
              > .de test_macro
              > ..
              > .test_macro
              > .test_macro some dummy arguments
              > ' | groff -m trace > /dev/null

              *** .de test_macro
              *** de trace enter: .test_macro
              *** trace exit: .test_macro
              *** de trace enter: .test_macro "some" "dummy" "arguments"
              *** trace exit: .test_macro "some" "dummy" "arguments"

       The entry and the exit of each macro call is displayed on the  terminal
       (standard output) -- together with the arguments (if any).

   NNeesstteedd mmaaccrroo ccaallllss
       Example:

              _s_h_# echo '.
              > .de child
              > ..
              > .de parent
              > .child
              > ..
              > .parent
              > ' | groff -m trace > /dev/null

              *** .de child
              *** .de parent
              *** de trace enter: .parent
               *** de trace enter: .child
               *** trace exit: .child
              *** trace exit: .parent

       This  shows  that macro calls can be nested.  This powerful feature can
       help to tack down quite complex call stacks.

       Example:

              _s_h_# echo '.
              > .de before
              > ..
              > .mso trace.tmac
              > .de after
              > ..
              > .before
              > .after
              > .before
              > ' | groff > /dev/null

              *** de trace enter: .after
              *** trace exit: .after

       Here, the tracing is activated within the document, not by  a  command-
       line  option.  As tracing was not active when macro _b_e_f_o_r_e was defined,
       no call of this macro is protocolled; on the other hand, the macro  _a_f_-
       _t_e_r is fully protocolled.

PPRROOBBLLEEMMSS
       Because ttrraaccee..ttmmaacc wraps the ..ddee request (and its cousins), macro argu-
       ments are expanded one level more.  This causes problems if an argument
       contains four backslashes or more to prevent too early expansion of the
       backslash.  For example, this macro call

              .foo \\\\n[bar]

       normally passes `\\n[bar]' to macro `.foo', but with the redefined  ..ddee
       request it passes `\n[bar]' instead.

       The  solution  to  this problem is to use groff's \\EE escape which is an
       escape character not interpreted in copy mode, for example

              .foo \En[bar]

FFIILLEESS
       The _t_r_a_c_e macros are kept in the file ttrraaccee..ttmmaacc located  in  the  _t_m_a_c
       _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y; see ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5) for details.
