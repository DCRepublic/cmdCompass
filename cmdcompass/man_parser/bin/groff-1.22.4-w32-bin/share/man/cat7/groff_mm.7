       The  groff  mm  macros  are  intended  to be compatible with the DWB mm
       macros with the following limitations:

       ••      No Bell Labs localisms are implemented.

       ••      The macros OK and PM are not implemented.

       ••      groff mm does not support cut marks.

       mmmm is intended to support easy localization.  Use mmmmssee  as  an  example
       how  to  adapt  the  output  format  to a national standard.  Localized
       strings  are   collected   in   the   file   _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/
       _t_m_a_c_/xx_._t_m_a_c, where _x_x denotes the two-letter code for the _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e, as
       defined in the ISO 639 standard.  For Swedish, this is ‘sv.tmac’ –  not
       ‘se’,  which  is  the ISO 3166 two-letter code for the _c_o_u_n_t_r_y (as used
       for the output format localization).

       A file called _l_o_c_a_l_e or country___l_o_c_a_l_e is read after the initialization
       of  the  global  variables.   It  is therefore possible to localize the
       macros with a different company name and so on.

       In this manual, square brackets are used to show optional arguments.

       Many macros can be controlled by number registers and strings.  A  num‐
       ber register is assigned with the nnrr command:

              ..nnrr _X_X_X [±±]_n [_i]

       _X_X_X  is  the  name  of the register, _n is the value to be assigned, and
       _i is the increment value for auto-increment.  _n can have a plus or  mi‐
       nus  sign as a prefix if an increment or decrement of the current value
       is wanted.  (Auto-increment or auto-decrement occurs if the number reg‐
       ister is used with a plus or minus sign, \\nn++[[_X_X_X]] or \\nn--[[_X_X_X]].)

       Strings are defined with ddss.

              ..ddss _Y_Y_Y _s_t_r_i_n_g

       The  string is assigned everything to the end of the line, even blanks.
       Initial blanks in  _s_t_r_i_n_g  should  be  prefixed  with  a  double-quote.
       (Strings are used in the text as \\**[[_Y_Y_Y]].)

       A  number  register is printed with normal digits if no format has been
       given.  Set the format with aaff:

              ..aaff _R _c

       _R is the name of the register, _c is the format.

              FFoorrmm   SSeeqquueennccee
              1      0, 1, 2, 3, ...

              001    000, 001, 002, 003, ...
              i      0, i, ii, iii, iv, ...
              I      0, I, II, III, IV, ...
              a      0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...
              A      0, A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...

   FFoonnttss
       In mmmm, the fonts (or rather, font styles) RR (normal), II  (italic),  and
       BB  (bold)  are  hardwired  to font positions 11, 22, and 33, respectively.
       Internally, font positions are used for backwards compatibility.   From
       a  practical point of view it doesn't make a big difference – a differ‐
       ent font family can still be selected with a call to the  ..ffaamm  request
       or  using  ggrrooffff's  --ff  command-line option.  On the other hand, if you
       want to replace just, say, font BB, you have to replace the font at  po‐
       sition 2 (with a call to ‘.fp 2 ...’).

   MMaaccrrooss
       ))EE _l_e_v_e_l _t_e_x_t
              Add heading text _t_e_x_t to the table of contents with _l_e_v_e_l, which
              is either 0 or in the range 1 to 7.  See also ..HH.  This macro is
              used for customized tables of contents.

       11CC [11] Begin  one-column  processing.   A 11 as an argument disables the
              page break.  Use wide footnotes, small footnotes  may  be  over‐
              printed.

       22CC     Begin  two-column  processing.   Splits the page in two columns.
              It is a special case of MMCC.  See also 11CC.

       AAEE     Abstract end, see AASS.

       AAFF [_n_a_m_e_-_o_f_-_f_i_r_m]
              Author's firm, should be called before AAUU, see also CCOOVVEERR.

       AALL [_t_y_p_e [_t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t [11]]]
              Start auto-increment list.  Items are  numbered  beginning  with
              one.  The _t_y_p_e argument controls the format of numbers.

                     AArrgg   DDeessccrriippttiioonn
                     1     Arabic (the default)
                     A     Upper-case letters (A–Z)
                     a     Lower-case letters (a–z)
                     I     Upper-case roman
                     i     Lower-case roman

              _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t  sets the indentation and overrides LLii.  A third ar‐
              gument prohibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       AAPPPP _n_a_m_e _t_e_x_t
              Begin an appendix with name _n_a_m_e.  Automatic  naming  occurs  if
              _n_a_m_e  is """".  The appendices start with AA if automatic naming is
              used.  A new page is ejected, and a header is also  produced  if
              the  number variable AApphh is non-zero.  This is the default.  The
              appendix always appears in the ‘List of contents’  with  correct
              page numbers.  The name ‘APPENDIX’ can be changed by setting the
              string AApppp to the desired text.  The string AAppppttxxtt contains  the
              current appendix text.

       AAPPPPSSKK _n_a_m_e _p_a_g_e_s _t_e_x_t
              Same  as  ..AAPPPP,  but  the page number is incremented with _p_a_g_e_s.
              This is used when diagrams or other non-formatted documents  are
              included as appendices.

       AASS [_a_r_g [_i_n_d_e_n_t]]
              Abstract  start.  Indentation is specified in ‘ens’, but scaling
              is  allowed.   Argument  _a_r_g  controls  where  the  abstract  is
              printed.

              AArrgg   PPllaacceemmeenntt
              0     Abstract  is  printed  on page 1 and on the cover sheet if
                    used in the released-paper style (MMTT 44), otherwise  it  is
                    printed on page 1 without a cover sheet.
              1     Abstract is only printed on the cover sheet (MMTT 44 only).
              2     Abstract is printed only on the cover sheet (other than MMTT
                    44 only).  The cover sheet is printed without  a  need  for
                    CCSS.

              An  abstract  is  not printed at all in external letters (MMTT 55).
              The _i_n_d_e_n_t parameter controls the indentation of  both  margins,
              otherwise normal text indentation is used.

       AASSTT [_t_i_t_l_e]
              Abstract title.  Default is ‘ABSTRACT’.  Sets the text above the
              abstract text.

       AATT _t_i_t_l_e_1 [_t_i_t_l_e_2 [...]]
              Author's title.  AATT must appear just after each AAUU.   The  title
              shows up after the name in the signature block.

       AAUU [_n_a_m_e [_i_n_i_t_i_a_l_s [_l_o_c [_d_e_p_t [_e_x_t [_r_o_o_m [_a_r_g [_a_r_g [_a_r_g]]]]]]]]]
              Author  information.  Specifies the author of the memo or paper,
              and is printed on the cover sheet and on other  similar  places.
              AAUU  must  not appear before TTLL.  The author information can con‐
              tain initials, location, department, telephone  extension,  room
              number or name and up to three extra arguments.

       AAVV [_n_a_m_e [11]]
              Approval  signature.   Generates an approval line with place for
              signature and date.  The string ‘APPROVED:’ can be changed  with
              variable  LLeettaapppp; it is replaced with an empty lin if there is a
              second argument.  The string ‘Date’ can be changed with variable
              LLeettddaattee.

       AAVVLL [_n_a_m_e]
              Letter signature.  Generates a line with place for signature.

       BB [_b_o_l_d_-_t_e_x_t [_p_r_e_v_-_f_o_n_t_-_t_e_x_t [_b_o_l_d [...]]]]
              Begin boldface.  No limit on the number of arguments.  All argu‐
              ments are concatenated to one word; the first, third and  so  on
              is printed in boldface.

       BB11     Begin  box (as the ms macro).  Draws a box around the text.  The
              text is indented one character, and  the  right  margin  is  one
              character shorter.

       BB22     End box.  Finishes the box started with BB11.

       BBEE     End bottom block, see BBSS.

       BBII [_b_o_l_d_-_t_e_x_t [_i_t_a_l_i_c_-_t_e_x_t [_b_o_l_d_-_t_e_x_t [...]]]]
              Bold-italic.  No limit on the number of arguments, see BB.

       BBLL [_t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t [11]]
              Start bullet list.  Initializes a list with a bullet and a space
              in the beginning of each list item (see LLII).  _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t  over‐
              rides  the  default  indentation of the list items set by number
              register PPii.  A third argument prohibits  printing  of  a  blank
              line before each item.

       BBRR [_b_o_l_d_-_t_e_x_t [_r_o_m_a_n_-_t_e_x_t [_b_o_l_d_-_t_e_x_t [...]]]]
              Bold-roman.  No limit on the number of arguments.

       BBSS     Bottom block start.  Begins the definition of a text block which
              is printed at the bottom of each page.  The block ends with BBEE.

       BBVVLL _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t [_m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t [11]]
              Start of broken variable-item list.  Broken  variable-item  list
              has  no fixed mark, it assumes that every LLII has a mark instead.
              The text always begins at the next line after the  mark.   _t_e_x_t_-
              _i_n_d_e_n_t  sets  the  indentation  to the text, and _m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t the
              distance from the current indentation to the mark.  A third  ar‐
              gument prohibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       CCOOVVEERR [_a_r_g]
              Begin  a coversheet definition.  It is important that ..CCOOVVEERR ap‐
              pears before any normal text.  This macro uses _a_r_g to build  the
              filename  _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_t_m_a_c_/_m_m_/arg_._c_o_v.   Therefore
              it is possible  to  create  unlimited  types  of  cover  sheets.
              _m_s_._c_o_v  is supposed to look like the ms cover sheet.  ..CCOOVVEERR re‐
              quires a ..CCOOVVEENNDD at the end of the cover definition.  Always use
              this order of the cover macros:

                     .COVER
                     .TL
                     .AF
                     .AU
                     .AT
                     .AS
                     .AE
                     .COVEND

              However, only ..TTLL and ..AAUU are required.

       CCOOVVEENNDD Finish  the  cover  description and print the cover page.  It is
              defined in the cover file.

       DDEE     Display end.  Ends a block of text or display that  begins  with
              DDSS or DDFF.

       DDFF [_f_o_r_m_a_t [_f_i_l_l [_r_i_n_d_e_n_t]]]
              Begin floating display (no nesting allowed).  A floating display
              is saved in a queue and is printed in the order  entered.   _F_o_r_‐
              _m_a_t, _f_i_l_l, and _r_i_n_d_e_n_t are the same as in DDSS.  Floating displays
              are controlled by the two number registers DDee and DDff.

              DDee rreeggiisstteerr

                     0   Nothing special, this is the default.
                     1   A page eject occurs after each printed display,  giv‐
                         ing  only  one display per page and no text following
                         it.

              DDff rreeggiisstteerr

                     0   Displays are printed at the end of each section (when
                         section-page  numbering  is  active) or at the end of
                         the document.
                     1   A new display is printed on the current page if there
                         is  enough  space, otherwise it is printed at the end
                         of the document.
                     2   One display is printed at the top  of  each  page  or
                         column (in multi-column mode).
                     3   Print  one  display  if there is enough space for it,
                         otherwise it is printed at the top of the  next  page
                         or column.



                     4   Print  as  many displays as possible in a new page or
                         column.  A page break occurs between each display  if
                         DDee is not zero.
                     5   Fill  the current page with displays and the rest be‐
                         ginning at a new page or column.  (This  is  the  de‐
                         fault.)   A page break occurs between each display if
                         DDee is not zero.

       DDLL [_t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t [11 [11]]]
              Dash list start.  Begins a list where each item is printed after
              a dash.  _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t changes the default indentation of the list
              items set by number register PPii.  A second argument prevents  an
              empty  line  between  each list item.  See LLII.  A third argument
              prohibits printing of a blank line before each item.

       DDSS [_f_o_r_m_a_t [_f_i_l_l [_r_i_n_d_e_n_t]]]
              Static display start.  Begins collection of text until DDEE.   The
              text  is  printed together on the same page, unless it is longer

                     2      _o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e replaces the number.

              EECC uses the number register EEcc as a counter.  It is possible  to
              use  ..aaff to change the format of the number.  If number register
              OOff is 1, the format of title uses a dash instead of a dot  after
              the number.

              The  string  LLee controls the title of the List of Equations; de‐
              fault is ‘LIST OF EQUATIONS’.  The List  of  Equations  is  only
              printed  if  number  register  LLee  is 1.  The default is 0.  The
              string LLiieecc contains the word ‘Equation’, which is  printed  be‐
              fore  the  number.  If _r_e_f_n_a_m_e is used, then the equation number
              is saved with ..SSEETTRR, and can be retrieved with ‘..GGEETTSSTT _r_e_f_n_a_m_e’.

              Special handling of the title occurs if EECC is used inside DDSS/DDEE;
              it is not affected by the format of DDSS.

              text _n_a_m_e or a default string if _n_a_m_e is not specified.  This is
              used  to  include  external  pictures; just give the size of the

       EEQQ [_l_a_b_e_l]
              Equation  start.  EEQQ/EENN are the delimiters for equations written
              for eeqqnn(1).  EEQQ/EENN must be inside of a DDSS/DDEE pair, except if  EEQQ
              is used to set options for eeqqnn only.  The _l_a_b_e_l argument appears
              at the right margin of the equation, centered vertically  within
              the DDSS/DDEE block, unless number register EEqq is 1.  Then the label
              appears at the left margin.

              If there are multiple EEQQ/EENN blocks within a single  DDSS/DDEE  pair,
              only the last equation label (if any) is printed.

              Exhibit  title.   The arguments are the same as for EECC.  EEXX uses
              the number register EExx as a counter.  The string LLxx controls the
              title  of  the  List of Exhibits; default is ‘LIST OF EXHIBITS’.
              The List of Exhibits is only printed if number register LLxx is 1,
              which  is  the  default.  The string LLiieexx contains the word ‘Ex‐
              hibit’, which is printed before the number.  If _r_e_f_n_a_m_e is used,
              the  exhibit  number  is  saved with ..SSEETTRR, and can be retrieved
              with ‘..GGEETTSSTT _r_e_f_n_a_m_e’.

              Special handling of the title occurs if EEXX is used inside DDSS/DDEE;
              it is not affected by the format of DDSS.

              Figure  title.   The  arguments are the same as for EECC.  FFGG uses
              the number register FFgg as a counter.  The string LLff controls the
              title of the List of Figures; default is ‘LIST OF FIGURES’.  The
              List of Figures is only printed if  number  register  LLff  is  1,
              which  is  the default.  The string LLiiffgg contains the word ‘Fig‐
              ure’, which is printed before the number.  If _r_e_f_n_a_m_e  is  used,
              then the figure number is saved with ..SSEETTRR, and can be retrieved

              notes are automatically numbered; the  number  is  available  in
              string  FF.   Just  add  \\**FF in the text.  By adding _l_a_b_e_l, it is
              possible to have other number or names on the footnotes.   Foot‐
              notes  in  displays  are  now possible.  An empty line separates
              footnotes; the height of the line is controlled by number regis‐

              was  placed.  This is displayed as ‘9999’ in pass 1.  See IINNIITTRR.
              If _v_a_r_n_a_m_e is used, GGEETTPPNN sets the stringvariable _v_a_r_n_a_m_e to the
              page number.

              QQrrff may be changed to support other languages.  Strings QQrrffhh and
              QQrrffpp are set by GGEETTRR and contain the page and header number, re‐
              spectively.

              Numbered section heading.  Section headers can have a level  be‐
              tween  1 and 14; level 1 is the top level.  The text is given in
              _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t, and must be surrounded by double quotes if it con‐
              tains spaces.  _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_-_s_u_f_f_i_x is added to the header in the text
              but not in the table of contents.  This  is  normally  used  for

                     Number  register  EEjj  controls  page  ejection before the

                     lines  before it; higher levels only get one.  A new page
                     is ejected before each first-level heading if number reg‐
                     ister EEjj is 1.  All levels below or equal the value of EEjj
                     get a new page.  Default value for EEjj is 0.

                     String HHPP controls the point size of each heading, in the
                     same  way  as HHFF controls the font.  A value of 0 selects
                     the default point size.  Default value is

                            00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

                     Beware that only the point size changes, not the vertical
                     size.  The latter can be controlled by the user-specified
                     macros HHXX and/or HHZZ.

                     Fourteen number registers named HH11 up to HH1144 contain  the
                     counter  for  each heading level.  The values are printed
                     using Arabic numerals; this can be changed with the macro
                     HHMM (see below).  All marks are concatenated before print‐
                     ing.  To avoid this, set number register HHtt to  1.   This
                     only prints the current heading counter at each heading.

                     The  following macros can be defined by the user to get a
                     finer control of vertical spacing, fonts, or  other  fea‐
                     tures.   Argument _l_e_v_e_l is the level-argument to HH, but 0
                     for unnumbered headings (see HHUU).  Argument _r_l_e_v_e_l is the
                     real  level;  it  is set to number register HHuu for unnum‐
                     bered headings.  Argument _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t is the text  argu‐
                     ment to HH and HHUU.

                     HHXX _l_e_v_e_l _r_l_e_v_e_l _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t
                            This  macro  is called just before the printing of
                            the heading.  The following registers  are  avail‐
                            able  for  HHXX.  Note that HHXX may alter }}00, }}22, and
                            ;;33.

                            }}00 (string)
                                   Contains the heading mark plus  two  spaces
                                   if _r_l_e_v_e_l is non-zero, otherwise empty.

                            ;;00 (register)
                                   Contains the position of the text after the
                                   heading.  0 means that the text should fol‐
                                   low  the  heading on the same line, 1 means
                                   that a line break should occur  before  the
                                   text,  and 2 means that a blank line should
                                   separate the heading and the text.

                            }}22 (string)
                                   Contains two spaces if register  ;;00  is  0.
                                   It is used to separate the heading from the
                                   text.  The string is empty if  ;;00  is  non-
                                   zero.

                            ;;33 (register)
                                   Contains  the  needed  space in units after
                                   the heading.  Default is 2v.  Can  be  used
                                   to  change things like numbering (}}00), ver‐
                                   tical spacing (}}22), and  the  needed  space
                                   after the heading.

                            This  macro is called after size and font calcula‐
                            tions and might be used to change indentation.

                     HHZZ _d_l_e_v_e_l _r_l_e_v_e_l _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t
                            This macro is called after  the  printing  of  the
                            heading,  just  before HH or HHUU exits.  Can be used
                            to change the page header according to the section
                            heading.

              Set  hyphenation  character.   Default value is ‘\%’.  Resets to
              the default if called  without  argument.   Hyphenation  can  be
              turned  off  by setting number register HHyy to 0 at the beginning
              of the file.

       HHMM [_a_r_g_1 [_a_r_g_2 [... [_a_r_g_1_4]]]]
              Heading mark style.  Controls the type of marking  for  printing
              of the heading counters.  Default is 1 for all levels.

              AArrgguummeenntt

              1      Arabic numerals.

       HHUU _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t
              Unnumbered  section  header.   HHUU behaves like HH at the level in
              number register HHuu.  See HH.

              Italic.  Changes the font to italic if called without arguments.
              With one argument it sets the word in italic.   With  two  argu‐
              ments it concatenates them and sets the first word in italic and
              the second in the previous font.  There is no limit on the  num‐
              ber of argument; all are concatenated.

              Begin  specification of the addressee and addressee's address in
              letter style.  Several names can be specified with empty  IIAA/IIEE-
              pairs, but only one address.  See LLTT.

              Italic-bold.  Even arguments are printed in italic, odd in bold‐
              face.  See II.

       IIEE     End the address specification after IIAA.

              Initialize the new index system and set the filename to  collect
              index  lines in with IINNDD.  Argument _t_y_p_e selects the type of in‐
              dex: page number, header marks or both.   The  default  is  page
              numbers.

              It  is  also  possible to create a macro that is responsible for
              formatting each row; just add the name of the macro as  a  third
              argument.   The  macro  is  then  called with the index as argu‐
              ment(s).

              ttyyppee

              N   Page numbers
              H   Header marks
              B   Both page numbers and header marks,  separated  with  a  tab
                  character.

       IINNIITTRR _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Initialize  the  cross  reference  macros.  Cross references are
              written to stderr and are supposed to be  redirected  into  file
              filename_._q_r_f.   Requires  two passes with groff; this is handled
              by a separate program called mmmmrrooffff(1).  This program exists be‐
              cause ggrrooffff(1) by default deactivates the unsafe operations that
              are required by IINNIITTRR.  The first pass looks  for  cross  refer‐
              ences, and the second one includes them.  IINNIITTRR can be used sev‐
              eral times, but it is only the first occurrence of IINNIITTRR that is
              active.

       IINNDD _a_r_g_1 [_a_r_g_2 [...]]
              Write  a line in the index file selected by IINNIITTII with all argu‐
              ments and the page number or header mark separated by tabs.

       IINNDDPP   Print the index by running the command specified by string vari‐
              able  IInnddccmmdd,  which has ‘sort -t\t’ as the default value.  IINNDDPP
              reads the output from the command to form the index, by  default
              in two columns (this can be changed by defining TTYYIINNDD).  The in‐
              dex is printed with string variable IInnddeexx as header, default  is
              ‘INDEX’.   One-column  processing is reactivated after the list.
              IINNDDPP calls the user-defined macros TTXXIINNDD, TTYYIINNDD,  and  TTZZIINNDD  if
              defined.   TTXXIINNDD  is  called before printing the string ‘INDEX’,
              TTYYIINNDD is called instead of printing ‘INDEX’, and TTZZIINNDD is called
              after  the  printing and should take care of restoring to normal
              operation again.

       IISSOODDAATTEE [00]
              Change the predefined date string in DDTT to ISO-format, this  is,
              ‘YYYY-MM-DD’.   This  can  also be done by adding --rrIIssoo==11 on the
              command line.  Reverts to old date format if argument is 00.

       LLBB _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t _m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t _p_a_d _t_y_p_e [_m_a_r_k [_L_I_-_s_p_a_c_e [_L_B_-_s_p_a_c_e]]]
              List-begin  macro.  This is the common macro used for all lists.
              _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t is the number of spaces to indent the text from  the
              current indentation.

              _p_a_d  and _m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t control where to put the mark.  The mark is
              placed within the mark area, and _m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t sets the number  of
              spaces  before  this  area.   By default it is 0.  The mark area
              ends where the text begins.  The start of the text is still con‐
              trolled by _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t.

              The mark is left-justified within the mark area if _p_a_d is 0.  If
              _p_a_d is greater than 0, _m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t is ignored, and the  mark  is
              placed  _p_a_d  spaces  before  the text.  This right-justifies the
              mark.

              If _t_y_p_e is 0 the list either has a hanging  indentation  or,  if
              argument _m_a_r_k is given, the string _m_a_r_k as a mark.

              If _t_y_p_e is greater than 0 automatic numbering occurs, using ara‐
              bic numbers if _m_a_r_k is empty.  _m_a_r_k can then be any of ‘1’, ‘A’,
              ‘a’, ‘I’, or ‘i’.

              _t_y_p_e selects one of six possible ways to display the mark.

              ttyyppee

                     1   x.
                     2   x)

                     4   [x]
                     5   <x>
                     6   {x}

              Every  item  in the list gets _L_I_-_s_p_a_c_e number of blank lines be‐
              fore them.  Default is 1.

              LLBB itself prints _L_B_-_s_p_a_c_e blank lines.  Default is 0.

       LLCC [_l_i_s_t_-_l_e_v_e_l]
              List-status clear.  Terminates all current active lists down  to
              _l_i_s_t_-_l_e_v_e_l,  or 0 if no argument is given.  This is used by HH to
              clear any active list.

       LLEE [11] List end.  Terminates the current list.  LLEE outputs a blank line
              if an argument is given.

       LLII [_m_a_r_k [11|22]]
              List  item preceding every item in a list.  Without argument, LLII
              prints the mark determined by the current list type.  By  giving
              LLII  one  argument,  it uses that as the mark instead.  Two argu‐
              ments to LLII makes _m_a_r_k a prefix to the current mark.   There  is
              no  separating space between the prefix and the mark if the sec‐
              ond argument is ‘2’ instead of ‘1’.  This behaviour can also  be
              achieved  by  setting  number  register  LLiimmsspp  to zero.  A zero
              length _m_a_r_k makes a hanging indentation instead.

              A blank line is printed before the list item by  default.   This
              behaviour  can be controlled by number register LLss.  Pre-spacing
              occurs for each list level less than or equal  to  LLss.   Default
              value is 99.  There is no nesting limit.

              The  indentation can be changed through number register LLii.  De‐
              fault is 6.

              All lists begin with a list  initialization  macro,  LLBB.   There
              are,  however,  seven predefined list types to make lists easier
              to use.  They all call LLBB with different default values.

       LLTT [_a_r_g]
              Format a letter in one of four different styles depending on the
              argument.  Also see section “Internals” below.

                     AArrgg   SSttyyllee
                     BL    Blocked.  Date line, return address,  writer's  ad‐
                           dress and closing begins at the center of the line.
                           All other lines begin at the left margin.
                     SB    Semi-blocked.  Same as  blocked,  except  that  the
                           first line in every paragraph is indented five spa‐
                           ces.
                     FB    Full-blocked.  All lines begin at the left margin.
                     SP    Simplified.  Almost the same  as  the  full-blocked
                           style.  Subject and the writer's identification are
                           printed in all-capital.

       LLOO _t_y_p_e [_a_r_g]
              Specify options in letter (see ..LLTT).  This  is  a  list  of  the
              standard options:

                     CN   Confidential notation.  Prints ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ on the
                          second line below the date line.  Any  argument  re‐
                          places  ‘CONFIDENTIAL’.   See  also  string variable
                          LLeettCCNN.
                     RN   Reference notation.  Prints ‘In reference  to:’  and
                          the  argument  two  lines  below the date line.  See
                          also string variable LLeettRRNN.
                     AT   Attention.  Prints ‘ATTENTION:’ and the argument be‐
                          low  the  inside  address.  See also string variable
                          LLeettAATT.
                     SA   Salutation.  Prints ’To Whom It May Concern:’ or the
                          argument  if  it  was  present.   The  salutation is
                          printed two lines below  the  inside  address.   See
                          also string variable LLeettSSAA.
                     SJ   Subject  line.   Prints the argument as subject pre‐
                          fixed with ‘SUBJECT:’ two lines below the inside ad‐
                          dress, except in letter type ‘SP’, where the subject
                          is printed in all-capital without any  prefix.   See
                          also string variable LLeettSSJJ.

       MMCC _c_o_l_u_m_n_-_s_i_z_e [_c_o_l_u_m_n_-_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_n]
              Begin  multiple  columns.  Return to normal with 11CC.  MMCC creates
              as many columns as the current line length permits.  _c_o_l_u_m_n_-_s_i_z_e
              is  the width of each column, and _c_o_l_u_m_n_-_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_n is the space
              between two columns.  Default separation is _c_o_l_u_m_n_-_s_i_z_e/15.  See
              also 11CC.

       MMLL _m_a_r_k [_t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t [11]]
              Marked  list  start.   The  _m_a_r_k argument is printed before each
              list item.  _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t sets the indent  and  overrides  LLii.   A
              third  argument  prohibits  printing of a blank line before each
              item.

       MMTT [_a_r_g [_a_d_d_r_e_s_s_e_e]]
              Memorandum type.  The argument _a_r_g is  part  of  a  filename  in
              _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_t_m_a_c_/_m_m_/*_._M_T.  Memorandum types 0 to 5
              are supported, including type ‘string’  (which  gets  internally
              mapped  to type 6).  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_e_e just sets a variable, used in the
              AT&T macros.

              aarrgg

                     0   Normal memorandum, no type printed.
                     1   Memorandum with ‘MEMORANDUM FOR FILE’ printed.
                     2   Memorandum with ‘PROGRAMMER'S NOTES’ printed.

              Move to a position, setting page  offset  to  _x_-_p_o_s.   If  _l_i_n_e_-
              _l_e_n_g_t_h is not given, the difference between current and new page
              offset is used.  Use PPGGFFOORRMM without arguments to return to  nor‐
              mal.

       MMUULLBB _c_w_1 _s_p_a_c_e_1 [_c_w_2 _s_p_a_c_e_2 [_c_w_3 ...]]
              Begin  a  special multi-column mode.  All columns widths must be
              specified.  The space between  the  columns  must  be  specified
              also.  The last column does not need any space definition.  MMUULLBB
              starts a diversion, and MMUULLEE ends the diversion and  prints  the
              columns.  The unit for the width and space arguments is ‘n’, but
              MMUULLBB accepts all normal unit specifications like  ‘c’  and  ‘i’.
              MMUULLBB operates in a separate environment.

       MMUULLNN   Begin  the next column.  This is the only way to switch the col‐
              umn.

       MMUULLEE   End the multi-column mode and print the columns.

       nnPP [_t_y_p_e]
              Print numbered paragraph with header level two.  See ..PP.

       NNCCOOLL   Force printing to the next column.  Don't use this together with
              the MMUULL** macros, see 22CC.

       NNSS [_a_r_g [11]]
              Print  different  types  of notations.  The argument selects be‐
              tween the predefined type of notations.  If the second  argument
              is available, then the argument becomes the entire notation.  If
              the argument doesn't select a predefined type, it is printed  as
              ‘Copy (_a_r_g) to’.  It is possible to add more standard notations,
              see the string variables LLeettnnss and LLeettnnssddeeff.

       NNDD _n_e_w_-_d_a_t_e
              New date.  Overrides the current date.  Date is not  printed  if
              _n_e_w_-_d_a_t_e is an empty string.

       OOFF [_a_r_g]
              Odd-page  footer,  a  line printed just above the normal footer.
              See EEFF and PPFF.

              This macro defines string EEOOPPooff.

       OOHH [_a_r_g]
              Odd-page header, a line printed just below  the  normal  header.
              See EEHH and PPHH.

              This macro defines string TTPPoohh.

       OOPP     Make  sure  that  the following text is printed at the top of an
              odd-numbered page.  Does not output an empty page  if  currently
              at the top of an odd page.

       PP [_t_y_p_e]
              Begin new paragraph.  PP without argument produces left-justified
              text, even the first line of the paragraph.  This is the same as
              setting _t_y_p_e to 0.  If the argument is 1, the first line of text
              following PP is indented by the number of spaces in number regis‐
              ter PPii, by default 5.

              Instead  of  giving  an  argument to PP it is possible to set the
              paragraph type in number register PPtt.  Using 0 and 1 is the same
              as adding that value to PP.  A value of 2 indents all paragraphs,
              except after headings, lists, and displays (this value can't  be
              used as an argument to PP itself).

              The  space between two paragraphs is controlled by number regis‐
              ter PPss, and is 1 by default (one blank line).

       PPGGFFOORRMM [_l_i_n_e_l_e_n_g_t_h [_p_a_g_e_l_e_n_g_t_h [_p_a_g_e_o_f_f_s_e_t [11]]]]
              Set line length, page length, and/or page  offset.   This  macro
              can be used for special formatting, like letter heads and other.
              It is normally the first command in a file,  though  it  is  not
              necessary.  PPGGFFOORRMM can be used without arguments to reset every‐
              thing after a MMOOVVEE call.  A line break is done unless the fourth
              argument is given.  This can be used to avoid the page number on
              the first page while setting new width and length.  (It seems as
              if this macro sometimes doesn't work too well.  Use the command-
              line arguments to change line length, page length, and page off‐
              set instead.)

       PPGGNNHH   No  header  is printed on the next page.  Used to get rid of the
              header in letters or other special texts.  This  macro  must  be
              used  before  any  text  to inhibit the page header on the first
              page.

       PPIICC [--BB] [--LL] [--CC] [--RR] [--II _n] _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e [_w_i_d_t_h [_h_e_i_g_h_t]]
              Include a PostScript file in the document.  The macro depends on
              mmmmrrooffff(1)  and IINNIITTRR.  The arguments --LL, --CC, --RR, and --II _n adjust
              the picture or indent it.  With no flag the picture is  adjusted
              to the left.  Adding --BB draws a box around the picture.  The op‐
              tional _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t can also be given to resize the picture.

       PPEE     Picture end.  Ends a picture for ppiicc(1).

       PPFF [_a_r_g]
              Page footer.  PPFF sets the line to be printed at  the  bottom  of
              each  page.  Empty by default.  See PPHH for the argument specifi‐
              cation.

              This macro defines string EEOOPPff.

       PPHH [_a_r_g]
              Page header, a line printed at the top of each page.  The  argu‐
              ment should be specified as

                     "'_l_e_f_t_-_p_a_r_t'_c_e_n_t_e_r_-_p_a_r_t'_r_i_g_h_t_-_p_a_r_t'"

              where  _l_e_f_t_-_p_a_r_t,  _c_e_n_t_e_r_-_p_a_r_t, and _r_i_g_h_t_-_p_a_r_t are printed left-
              justified, centered, and right justified, respectively.   Within
              the  argument to PPHH, the character ‘%’ is changed to the current
              page number.  The default argument is

                     "''- % -''"

              which gives the page number between two dashes.

              This macro defines string TTPPhh.

       PPSS     Picture start (from pic).  Begins a picture for ppiicc(1).

       PPXX     Page header user-defined exit.  This macro is called just  after
              the printing of the page header in _n_o_-_s_p_a_c_e mode.

       RR      Roman.  Return to roman font, see also II.

              Roman-bold.   Even  arguments are printed in roman, odd in bold‐
              face.  See II.

       RRDD [_p_r_o_m_p_t [_d_i_v_e_r_s_i_o_n [_s_t_r_i_n_g]]]
              Read from standard input to diversion and/or string.   The  text
              is  saved  in  a  diversion named _d_i_v_e_r_s_i_o_n.  Recall the text by
              writing the name of the diversion after a dot on an empty  line.
              A  string  is also defined if _s_t_r_i_n_g is given.  _D_i_v_e_r_s_i_o_n and/or
              _p_r_o_m_p_t can be empty ("").

       RRFF     Reference end.  Ends a reference definition and returns to  nor‐
              mal processing.  See RRSS.

       RRII [_r_o_m_a_n_-_t_e_x_t [_i_t_a_l_i_c_-_t_e_x_t [_r_o_m_a_n_-_t_e_x_t [...]]]]
              Print even arguments in roman, odd in italic.  See II.

       RRLL [_t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t[11]]
              Reference list start.  Begins a list where each item is preceded
              with an automatically incremented number between  square  brack‐
              ets.  _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t changes the default indentation.

       RRPP [_a_r_g_1 [_a_r_g_2]]
              Produce  reference  page.  This macro can be used if a reference
              page is wanted somewhere in the document.  It is not  needed  if
              TTCC  is  used to produce a table of contents.  The reference page
              is then printed automatically.

              The reference counter is not reset if _a_r_g_1 is 1.

              _a_r_g_2 tells RRPP whether to eject a page or not.

              aarrgg22

                     0   The reference page is printed on a separate page.
                     1   Do not eject page after the list.
                     2   Do not eject page before the list.
                     3   Do not eject page before and after the list.

              The reference items are separated by a blank line.  Setting num‐
              ber register LLss to 0 suppresses the line.

              The  string  RRpp  contains the reference page title and is set to
              ‘REFERENCES’ by default.  The number register RRppee holds the  de‐
              fault  value  for the second argument of RRPP; it is initially set
              to 0.

       RRSS [_s_t_r_i_n_g_-_n_a_m_e]
              Begin an automatically numbered reference definition.   Put  the
              string  \\**((RRff  where  the reference mark should be and write the
              reference between RRSS/RRFF at next new  line  after  the  reference
              mark.  The reference number is stored in number register ::RR.  If
              _s_t_r_i_n_g_-_n_a_m_e is given, a string with that  name  is  defined  and
              contains  the  current reference mark.  The string can be refer‐
              enced as \\**[[_s_t_r_i_n_g_-_n_a_m_e]] later in the text.

       SS [_s_i_z_e [_s_p_a_c_i_n_g]]
              Set point size and vertical spacing.  If any argument  is  equal
              to  ‘P’, the previous value is used.  A ‘C’ means current value,
              and ‘D’ the default value.  If ‘+’ or ‘-’  is  used  before  the
              value,  the current value is incremented or decremented, respec‐
              tively.

       SSAA [_a_r_g]
              Set right-margin justification.  Justification is turned  on  by
              default.   No argument or value ‘0’ turns off justification, and
              ‘1’ turns on justification.

       SSEETTRR _r_e_f_n_a_m_e [_s_t_r_i_n_g]
              Remember the current header and page number as  _r_e_f_n_a_m_e.   Saves
              _s_t_r_i_n_g  if  _s_t_r_i_n_g is defined.  _s_t_r_i_n_g is retrieved with ..GGEETTSSTT.
              See IINNIITTRR.

       SSGG [_a_r_g [11]]
              Signature line.  Prints the authors  name(s)  after  the  formal
              closing.   The  argument  is  appended  to  the  reference data,
              printed at either the first or last author.  The reference  data
              is  the  location,  department, and initials specified with ..AAUU.
              It is printed at the first author  if  the  second  argument  is
              given,  otherwise  at the last.  No reference data is printed if
              the author(s) is specified through ..WWAA/..WWEE.  See section “Inter‐
              nals” below.

       SSKK [_p_a_g_e_s]
              Skip  pages.   If _p_a_g_e_s is 0 or omitted, a skip to the next page
              occurs unless it is already at the top of a page.  Otherwise  it
              skips _p_a_g_e_s pages.

       SSMM _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 [_s_t_r_i_n_g_2 [_s_t_r_i_n_g_3]]
              Make  a  string  smaller.   If _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is given, _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 is made
              smaller and _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 stays  at  normal  size,  concatenated  with
              _s_t_r_i_n_g_1.   With three arguments, everything is concatenated, but
              only _s_t_r_i_n_g_2 is made smaller.

       SSPP [_l_i_n_e_s]
              Space vertically.  _l_i_n_e_s can have any scaling factor, like  ‘3i’
              or  ‘8v’.   Several SSPP calls in a line only produces the maximum
              number of lines, not the sum.  SSPP  is  ignored  also  until  the
              first  text line in a page.  Add \\&& before a call to SSPP to avoid
              this.

       TTAABB    Reset tabs to every 5n.  Normally used to reset any previous tab
              positions.

       TTBB [_t_i_t_l_e [_o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e [_f_l_a_g [_r_e_f_n_a_m_e]]]]
              Table title.  The arguments are the same as for EECC.  TTBB uses the
              number register TTbb as a counter.  The string LLtt controls the ti‐
              tle  of  the  List of Tables; default value is ‘LIST OF TABLES’.
              The List of Tables is only printed if number register LLtt  is  1,
              which  is  the  default.  The string LLiittbb contains the word ‘TA‐
              BLE’, which is printed before the number.

              Special handling of the title occurs if TTBB is used inside DDSS/DDEE,
              it is not affected by the format of DDSS.

       TTCC [_s_l_e_v_e_l [_s_p_a_c_i_n_g [_t_l_e_v_e_l [_t_a_b [_h_1 [_h_2 [_h_3 [_h_4 [_h_5]]]]]]]]]
              Table of contents.  This macro is normally used as the last line
              of the document.  It generates a table of contents with headings
              up  to the level controlled by number register CCll.  Note that CCll
              controls the saving of headings, it has nothing to do  with  TTCC.
              Headings  with  a level less than or equal to _s_l_e_v_e_l get _s_p_a_c_i_n_g
              number of lines before them.  Headings with a level less than or
              equal  to  _t_l_e_v_e_l  have  their page numbers right-justified with
              dots or spaces separating the text and the page number.   Spaces
              are  used  if  _t_a_b  is greater than zero, dots otherwise.  Other
              headings have the page number directly at the end of the heading
              text (_r_a_g_g_e_d_-_r_i_g_h_t).

              The rest of the arguments is printed, centered, before the table
              of contents.

              The user-defined macros TTXX and TTYY are used if TTCC is called  with
              at most four arguments.  TTXX is called before the printing of the
              string ‘CONTENTS’, and TTYY is called instead  of  printing  ‘CON‐
              TENTS’.

              Equivalent  macros  can  be defined for list of figures, tables,
              equations and exhibits by defining TTXX_x_x or  TTYY_x_x,  where  _x_x  is
              ‘Fg’, ‘TB’, ‘EC’, or ‘EX’, respectively.

              String  CCii can be set to control the indentations for each head‐
              ing-level.  It must be scaled, like

                     .ds Ci .25i .5i .75i 1i 1i

              By default, the indentation is controlled by the maximum  length
              of headings in each level.

              The  string  variables LLiiffgg, LLiittbb, LLiieexx, LLiieecc, and LLiiccoonn contain
              ‘Figure’, ‘TABLE’, ‘Exhibit’, ‘Equation’,  and  ‘CONTENTS’,  re‐
              spectively.  These can be redefined to other languages.

       TTEE     Table end.  See TTSS.

       TTHH [NN] Table  header.   See TTSS.  TTHH ends the header of the table.  This
              header is printed again if a page break  occurs.   Argument  ‘N’
              isn't implemented yet.

              Begin  title  of  memorandum.  All text up to the next AAUU is in‐
              cluded in the title.  _c_h_a_r_g_i_n_g_-_c_a_s_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and  _f_i_l_i_n_g_-_c_a_s_e_-_n_u_m_‐
              _b_e_r are saved for use in the front page processing.

       TTMM [_n_u_m_1 [_n_u_m_2 [...]]]
              Technical  memorandum  numbers used in ..MMTT.  An unlimited number
              of arguments may be given.

       TTPP     Top-of-page user-defined macro.  This macro is called instead of
              the  normal page header.  It is possible to get complete control
              over the header.  Note  that  the  header  and  the  footer  are
              printed  in  a  separate environment.  Line length is preserved,
              though.  See EEOOPP.

       TTSS [HH] Table start.  This is the start  of  a  table  specification  to
              ttbbll(1).   TTSS ends with TTEE.  Argument ‘H’ tells mmmm that the table
              has a header.  See TTHH.

       TTXX     User-defined table of contents exit.  This macro is called  just
              before TTCC prints the word ‘CONTENTS’.  See TTCC.

       TTYY     User-defined  table  of contents exit.  This macro is called in‐
              stead of printing ‘CONTENTS’.  See TTCC.

              Begin verbatim output using Courier font.  Usually for  printing
              programs.   All characters have equal width.  The point size can
              be changed with the second argument.  By specifying a third  ar‐
              gument  it  is  possible to use another font instead of Courier.
              _f_l_a_g controls several special features.  Its value is the sum of
              all wanted features.

                     1     Disable the escape character (\).  This is normally
                           turned on during verbose output.
                     2     Add an empty line before the verbose text.
                     4     Add an empty line after the verbose text.
                     8     Print the verbose text with numbered  lines.   This
                           adds  four  digit-sized  spaces in the beginning of
                           each line.  Finer control  is  available  with  the
                           string  variable VVeerrbbnnmm.  It contains all arguments
                           to the ttrrooffff(1) command ..nnmm, normally ‘1’.
                     16    Indent the verbose text  by  ‘5n’.   This  is  con‐
                           trolled by the number-variable VVeerrbbiinn (in units).

              Variable-item list.  It has no fixed mark, it assumes that every
              LLII has a mark instead.  _t_e_x_t_-_i_n_d_e_n_t sets the indent to the text,
              and _m_a_r_k_-_i_n_d_e_n_t the distance from the current indentation to the
              mark.  A third argument prohibits printing of a blank  line  be‐
              fore each item.

       VVMM [--TT] [_t_o_p [_b_o_t_t_o_m]]

              _b_o_t_t_o_m, respectively.  If option --TT is specified, set those mar‐
              gins to _t_o_p and _b_o_t_t_o_m.  If no argument is given, reset the mar‐
              gin to zero, or to the default (‘7v 5v’) if --TT is used.   It  is
              highly  recommended that macros TTPP and/or EEOOPP are defined if us‐

IINNTTEERRNNAALLSS
       The letter macros are using different submacros depending on the letter
       type.  The name of the submacro has the letter type as suffix.   It  is
       therefore possible to define other letter types, either in the national
       macro-file, or as local additions.  ..LLTT sets the  number  variables  PPtt
       and PPii to 0 and 5, respectively.  The following strings and macros must
       be defined for a new letter type.

       lleett@@iinniitt___t_y_p_e
              This macro is called directly by ..LLTT.  It is  supposed  to  ini‐
              tialize variables and other stuff.

       lleett@@hheeaadd___t_y_p_e
              This  macro prints the letter head, and is called instead of the
              normal  page  header.   It  is  supposed  to  remove  the  alias
              lleett@@hheeaaddeerr, otherwise it is called for all pages.

       lleett@@ssgg___t_y_p_e _n_a_m_e _t_i_t_l_e _n _f_l_a_g [_a_r_g_1 [_a_r_g_2 [...]]]
              ..SSGG is calling this macro only for letters; memorandums have its
              own processing.  _n_a_m_e and _t_i_t_l_e are specified  through  ..WWAA/..WWBB.
              _n  is  the  counter,  1-max, and _f_l_a_g is true for the last name.
              Any other argument to ..SSGG is appended.

       lleett@@ffcc___t_y_p_e _c_l_o_s_i_n_g
              This macro is called by ..FFCC, and has the formal closing  as  the
              argument.

       ..LLOO is implemented as a general option-macro.  It demands that a string
       named LLeett_t_y_p_e is defined, where _t_y_p_e is the letter type.  ..LLOO then  as‐
       signs the argument to the string variable lleett**lloo--_t_y_p_e.
