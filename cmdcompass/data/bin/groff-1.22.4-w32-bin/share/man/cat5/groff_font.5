       groff_font - format of groff device and font description files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The groff font format is roughly a superset of the ditroff font format.
       The font files for device _n_a_m_e  are  stored  in  a  directory  _d_e_vname.
       There  are two types of file: a device description file called _D_E_S_C and
       for each font _F, a font file called F.  These are  text  files;  unlike
       the ditroff font format, there is no associated binary format.

   DDEESSCC ffiillee ffoorrmmaatt
       The  _D_E_S_C  file can contain the following types of line as shown below.
       Later entries in the file override previous values.

       Empty lines are ignored.

       cchhaarrsseett
              This line and everything following in the file are ignored.   It
              is allowed for the sake of backwards compatibility.

       ffaammiillyy _f_a_m
              The default font family is _f_a_m.

       ffoonnttss _n _F_1 _F_2 _F_3 _._._. _F_n
              Fonts  _F_1,  ...,  _F_n are mounted in the font positions _m+1, ...,
              _m+_n where _m is the number of styles.  This  command  may  extend
              over  more than one line.  A font name of 00 causes no font to be
              mounted on the corresponding font position.

       hhoorr _n  The horizontal resolution is _n machine units.

       iimmaaggee__ggeenneerraattoorr _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Needed for ggrroohhttmmll only.  It specifies the program  to  generate
              PNG  images from PostScript input.  Under GNU/Linux this is usu-
              ally _g_s but under other systems (notably cygwin) it might be set
              to another name.

       ppaappeerrlleennggtthh _n
              The  physical vertical dimension of the output medium in machine
              units.  This isn't used by ttrrooffff itself but by  output  devices.
              Deprecated.  Use ppaappeerrssiizzee instead.

       ppaappeerrssiizzee _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Select  a paper size.  Valid values for _s_t_r_i_n_g are the ISO paper
              types A0-A7, B0-B7, C0-C7, D0-D7, DL, and  the  US  paper  types
              letter, legal, tabloid, ledger, statement, executive, com10, and
              monarch.  Case is not significant for _s_t_r_i_n_g if it holds  prede-
              fined  paper  types.   Alternatively,  _s_t_r_i_n_g can be a file name
              (e.g. _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_p_e_r_s_i_z_e); if the file can be  opened,  ggrrooffff  reads
              the  first  line  and tests for the above paper sizes.  Finally,
              _s_t_r_i_n_g can be a custom paper size in the format _l_e_n_g_t_h,,_w_i_d_t_h (no
              spaces  before and after the comma).  Both _l_e_n_g_t_h and _w_i_d_t_h must
              have a unit appended; valid values are `i' for inches,  `c'  for
              centimeters,  `p'  for  points,  and  `P'  for  picas.  Example:
              1122cc,,223355pp.  An argument which  starts  with  a  digit  is  always
              treated  as a custom paper format.  ppaappeerrssiizzee sets both the ver-
              tical and horizontal dimension of the output medium.

              More than one argument can be specified; ggrrooffff scans  from  left
              to right and uses the first valid paper specification.

       ppaappeerrwwiiddtthh _n
              The  physical  horizontal  dimension  of  the  output  medium in
              machine units.  Deprecated.  Use ppaappeerrssiizzee instead.  This  isn't
              used by ttrrooffff itself but by output devices.

       ppaassss__ffiilleennaammeess
              Make troff tell the driver the source file name being processed.
              This is achieved by another tcommand: FF _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

       ppoossttpprroo _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
              Use _p_r_o_g_r_a_m as the postprocessor.

       pprreepprroo _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
              Call _p_r_o_g_r_a_m as a preprocessor.

       pprriinntt _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
              Use _p_r_o_g_r_a_m as the spooler program for  printing.   If  omitted,
              the --ll and --LL options of ggrrooffff are ignored.

       rreess _n  There are _n machine units per inch.

       ssiizzeess _s_1 _s_2 _._._. _s_n 00
              This  means  that the device has fonts at _s_1, _s_2, ..., _s_n scaled
              points.  The list of sizes must be terminated by a 00.   Each  _s_i
              can also be a range of sizes _m-_n.  The list can extend over more
              than one line.

       ssiizzeessccaallee _n
              The scale factor for point sizes.  By default this has  a  value
              of  1.  One _s_c_a_l_e_d _p_o_i_n_t is equal to one point/_n.  The arguments
              to the uunniittwwiiddtthh and ssiizzeess commands are given in scaled points.

       ssttyylleess _S_1 _S_2 _._._. _S_m
              The first _m font positions are associated with styles  _S_1,  ...,
              _S_m.

       ttccoommmmaanndd
              This  means that the postprocessor can handle the tt and uu output
              commands.

       uunniiccooddee
              Indicate that the output device supports  the  complete  Unicode
              repertoire.   Useful  only  for  devices which produce _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r
              _e_n_t_i_t_i_e_s instead of glyphs.

              If uunniiccooddee is present, no cchhaarrsseett section  is  required  in  the
              font  description  files  since  the Unicode handling built into
              ggrrooffff is used.  However, if there are entries in a cchhaarrsseett  sec-
              tion,  they  either override the default mappings for those par-
              ticular characters or add new mappings (normally  for  composite
              characters).

              This is used for --TTuuttff88, --TThhttmmll, and --TTxxhhttmmll.

       uunniittwwiiddtthh _n
              Quantities  in  the  font  files  are given in machine units for
              fonts whose point size is _n scaled points.

       uunnssccaalleedd__cchhaarrwwiiddtthhss
              Make the font  handling  module  always  return  unscaled  glyph
              widths.  Needed for the ggrroohhttmmll device.

       uussee__cchhaarrnnaammeess__iinn__ssppeecciiaall
              This  command  indicates  that  troff should encode named glyphs
              inside special commands.

       vveerrtt _n The vertical resolution is _n machine units.

       The rreess, uunniittwwiiddtthh, ffoonnttss, and ssiizzeess lines  are  compulsory.   Not  all
       commands  in  the  _D_E_S_C file are used by ttrrooffff itself; some of the key-
       words (or even additional ones) are used  by  postprocessors  to  store
       arbitrary information about the device.

       Here a list of obsolete keywords which are recognized by ggrrooffff but com-
       pletely ignored: ssppaarree11, ssppaarree22, bbiiggggeessttffoonntt.

   FFoonntt ffiillee ffoorrmmaatt
       A font file has two sections; empty lines are ignored in both of them.

       The first section is a sequence of lines each containing a sequence  of
       blank  delimited words; the first word in the line is a key, and subse-
       quent words give a value for that key.

       lliiggaattuurreess _l_i_g_1 _l_i_g_2 _._._. _l_i_g_n [00]
              Glyphs _l_i_g_1, _l_i_g_2, ..., _l_i_g_n are ligatures;  possible  ligatures
              are  ffff, ffii, ffll, ffffii, and ffffll.  For backwards compatibility, the
              list of ligatures may be terminated with a 00.  The list of liga-
              tures may not extend over more than one line.

       nnaammee _F The name of the font is _F.

       ssllaanntt _n
              The  glyphs  of  the  font have a slant of _n degrees.  (Positive
              means forward.)

       ssppaacceewwiiddtthh _n
              The normal width of a space is _n.

       ssppeecciiaall
              The font is _s_p_e_c_i_a_l; this means that when a glyph  is  requested
              that  is  not present in the current font, it is searched for in
              any special fonts that are mounted.

       Other commands are ignored by ttrrooffff but may be used  by  postprocessors
       to store arbitrary information about the font in the font file.

       The first section can contain comments which start with the ## character
       and extend to the end of a line.

       The second section contains one or two subsections.  It must contain  a
       _c_h_a_r_s_e_t  subsection  and  it  may  also contain a _k_e_r_n_p_a_i_r_s subsection.
       These subsections can appear in any order.  Each subsection starts with
       a word on a line by itself.

       The  word  cchhaarrsseett  starts the charset subsection.  The cchhaarrsseett line is
       followed by a sequence of lines.  Each line gives information  for  one
       glyph.   A  line  comprises  a  number of fields separated by blanks or
       tabs.  The format is

              _n_a_m_e _m_e_t_r_i_c_s _t_y_p_e _c_o_d_e [_e_n_t_i_t_y___n_a_m_e] [---- _c_o_m_m_e_n_t]

       _n_a_m_e identifies the glyph: if _n_a_m_e is a single glyph _c then  it  corre-
       sponds  to the groff input character _c; if it is of the form \\_c where c
       is a single character, then it corresponds  to  the  special  character
       \\[[_c]];  otherwise  it  corresponds to the groff input character \\[[_n_a_m_e]].
       If it is exactly two characters _x_x it can be  entered  as  \\((_x_x.   Note
       that single-letter special characters can't be accessed as \\_c; the only
       exception is `\-' which is identical to `\[-]'.  The name ------  is  spe-
       cial  and  indicates that the glyph is unnamed; such glyphs can only be
       used by means of the \\NN escape sequence in ttrrooffff.

       The _t_y_p_e field gives the glyph type:

       1      means the glyph has a descender, for example, `p';

       2      means the glyph has an ascender, for example, `b';

       3      means the glyph has both an ascender and a descender, for  exam-
              ple, `('.

       The _c_o_d_e field gives the code which the postprocessor uses to print the
       glyph.  The glyph can also be input to groff using this code  by  means
       of  the \\NN escape sequence.  The code can be any integer.  If it starts
       with a 00 it is interpreted as octal; if it starts with 00xx or 00XX  it  is
       interpreted as hexadecimal.  Note, however, that the \\NN escape sequence
       only accepts a decimal integer.

       The _e_n_t_i_t_y___n_a_m_e field gives an ASCII string identifying the glyph which
       the postprocessor uses to print that glyph.  This field is optional and
       is currently used by ggrrooppss to build sub-encoding arrays  for  PS  fonts
       containing  more than 256 glyphs.  (It has also been used for ggrroohhttmmll's
       entity names but for efficiency  reasons  this  data  is  now  compiled
       directly into ggrroohhttmmll.)

       Anything on the line after the encoding field or `--' are ignored.

       The  _m_e_t_r_i_c_s field has the form (in one line; it is broken here for the
       sake of readability):

              _w_i_d_t_h[,,_h_e_i_g_h_t[,,_d_e_p_t_h[,,_i_t_a_l_i_c_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n
              [,,_l_e_f_t_-_i_t_a_l_i_c_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n[,,_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n]]]]]

       There must not be any spaces between  these  subfields.   Missing  sub-
       fields  are  assumed  to be 0.  The subfields are all decimal integers.
       Since there is no  associated  binary  format,  these  values  are  not
       required  to  fit  into a variable of type cchhaarr as they are in ditroff.
       The _w_i_d_t_h subfields gives the width of the glyph.  The _h_e_i_g_h_t  subfield
       gives  the  height  of the glyph (upwards is positive); if a glyph does
       not extend above the baseline, it should be given a zero height, rather
       than  a  negative  height.   The  _d_e_p_t_h subfield gives the depth of the
       glyph, that is, the distance below the  baseline  to  which  the  glyph
       extends  (downwards  is positive); if a glyph does not extend below the
       baseline, it should be given a  zero  depth,  rather  than  a  negative
       depth.   The  _i_t_a_l_i_c_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n subfield gives the amount of space that
       should be added after the glyph when it is immediately to  be  followed
       by  a  glyph  from  a  roman font.  The _l_e_f_t_-_i_t_a_l_i_c_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n subfield
       gives the amount of space that should be added before the glyph when it
       is  immediately  to be preceded by a glyph from a roman font.  The _s_u_b_-
       _s_c_r_i_p_t_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n gives the amount of space that should be added  after
       a glyph before adding a subscript.  This should be less than the italic
       correction.

       A line in the charset section can also have the format

              _n_a_m_e ""

       This indicates that _n_a_m_e is just another name for the  glyph  mentioned
       in the preceding line.

       The  word  kkeerrnnppaaiirrss  starts  the  kernpairs  section.  This contains a
       sequence of lines of the form:

              _c_1 _c_2 _n

       This means that when glyph _c_1  appears  next  to  glyph  _c_2  the  space
       between  them should be increased by _n.  Most entries in kernpairs sec-
       tion have a negative value for _n.
