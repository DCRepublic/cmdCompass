       ggrrooppddff translates the output of GNU  ttrrooffff  to  PDF.   Normally  ggrrooppddff
       should  be  invoked by using the groff command with a --TTppddff option.  If
       no files are given, ggrrooppddff reads the standard input.  A filename  of  --
       also  causes  ggrrooppddff to read the standard input.  PDF output is written
       to the standard output.  When ggrrooppddff is run by  ggrrooffff  options  can  be
       passed to ggrrooppddff using ggrrooffff's --PP option.

       See  section "Font Installation" below for a guide how to install fonts
       for ggrrooppddff.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --dd     Include debug information as comments within the PDF.  Also pro-
              duces an uncompressed PDF.

       --ee     Forces ggrrooppddff to embed _a_l_l fonts (even the 14 base PDF fonts).

       --FF _d_i_r Prepend  directory  _d_i_r/dev_n_a_m_e to the search path for font, and
              device description files; _n_a_m_e is the name of the  device,  usu-
              ally ppddff.

       --II _d_i_r This  option  may  be used to add a directory to the search path
              for files named in \\XX''ppddff:: ppddffppiicc'' escape.  The  current  direc-
              tory  is  always  searched  first.  This option may be specified
              more than once; the directories are then searched in  the  order
              specified.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file
              name.

       --ll     Orient the document in landscape format.

       --pp _p_a_p_e_r_-_s_i_z_e
              Set physical dimension of output  medium.   This  overrides  the
              ppaappeerrssiizzee,  ppaappeerrlleennggtthh,  and  ppaappeerrwwiiddtthh  commands  in the _D_E_S_C
              file; it accepts the same arguments as  the  ppaappeerrssiizzee  command.
              See ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for details.

       --ss     Append  a  comment  line  to end of PDF showing statistics, i.e.
              number of pages in  document.   Ghostscript's  ppss22ppddff  complains
              about this line if it is included, but works anyway.

       --uu       [_c_m_a_p_f_i_l_e]  GGrrooppddff normally includes a ToUnicode CMap with any
              font created using _t_e_x_t_._e_n_c as the encoding file, this makes  it
              easier  to  search  for  words which contain ligatures.  You can
              include your own CMap by specifying a _c_m_a_p_f_i_l_e or have  no  CMap
              at all by omitting the argument.

       --vv
       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Print the version number and exit.

       --yy _f_o_u_n_d_r_y
              Set the foundry to use for selecting fonts of the same name.

UUSSAAGGEE
       The  input to ggrrooppddff must be in the format output by ttrrooffff(1).  This is
       described in ggrrooffff__oouutt(5).

       In addition, the device and font description files for the device  used
       must  meet certain requirements: The resolution must be an integer mul-
       tiple of 72 times the ssiizzeessccaallee.  The ppddff device uses a  resolution  of
       72000 and a sizescale of 1000.

       The  device  description  file  must  contain  a  valid paper size; see
       ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for more information.  ggrrooppddff uses the same Type 1  Adobe
       PostScript fonts as the ggrrooppss device driver.  Although the PDF Standard
       allows the use of other font types (like TrueType) this  implementation
       only  accepts  the Type 1 PostScript font.  Fewer Type 1 fonts are sup-
       ported natively in PDF documents than the standard 35  fonts  supported
       by  ggrrooppss  and all PostScript printers, but all the fonts are available
       since any which aren't supported natively are automatically embedded in
       the PDF.

       ggrrooppddff supports the concept of foundries, that is different versions of
       basically the same font.  During install a _F_o_u_n_d_r_y file controls  where
       fonts  are  found and builds ggrrooffff fonts from the files it discovers on
       your system.

       Each font description file must contain a command

              iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee _p_s_n_a_m_e

       which says that the PostScript name  of  the  font  is  _p_s_n_a_m_e.   Lines
       starting with ## and blank lines are ignored.  The code for each charac-
       ter given in the font file must correspond to the code in  the  default
       encoding  for  the  font.   This  code  can  be used with the \\NN escape
       sequence in ttrrooffff to select the character, even if the  character  does
       not  have a groff name.  Every character in the font file must exist in
       the PostScript font, and the widths given in the font file  must  match
       the widths used in the PostScript font.

       Note that ggrrooppddff is currently only able to display the first 256 glyphs
       in any font.  This restriction will be lifted in a later version.

       ggrrooppddff can automatically include the downloadable  fonts  necessary  to
       print the document.  Fonts may be in PFA or PFB format.

       Any  downloadable  fonts  which  should,  when required, be included by
       ggrrooppddff  must  be  listed   in   the   file   _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/
       _f_o_n_t_/_d_e_v_p_d_f_/_d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d; this should consist of lines of the form

              _f_o_u_n_d_r_y _f_o_n_t _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

       where  _f_o_u_n_d_r_y  is  the  foundry name or blank for the default foundry.
       _f_o_n_t is the PostScript name of the font, and _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is  the  name  of
       the  file  containing  the font; lines beginning with ## and blank lines
       are ignored; fields must be separated by tabs (spaces are nnoott allowed);
       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is  searched  for  using  the same mechanism that is used for
       groff font metric files.  The _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file itself is also searched for
       using  this mechanism; currently, only the first found file in the font
       path is used.  Foundry names are usually a single  character  (such  as
       `U'  for  the  URW  Foundry)  or  blank  for the default foundry.  This
       default uses the same fonts as gghhoossttssccrriipptt uses when it embeds fonts in
       a PDF file.

       In the default setup there are styles called RR, II, BB, and BBII mounted at
       font positions 1 to 4.  The fonts are grouped into families AA,  BBMM,  CC,
       HH, HHNN, NN, PP, and TT having members in each of these styles:

              TTBB     Times-Bold
              TTBBII    Times-BoldItalic

       There is also the following font which is not a member of a family:

              ZZCCMMII   ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       There are also some special fonts called SS for the PS Symbol font.  The
       lower case greek characters are automatically  slanted  (to  match  the
       SymbolSlanted  font  (SS)  available  to PostScript).  Zapf Dingbats is
       available as ZZDD, the "hand pointing left" glyph  (\[lh])  is  available
       since  it  has  been  defined  using  the \X'pdf: xrev' extension which
       reverses the direction of letters within words.

       The default color for \\mm and \\MM is black.

       ggrrooppddff understands some of the X commands produced using the \\XX  escape
       sequences  supported  by  ggrrooppss..   Specifically,  the following is sup-
       ported.

       \\XX''ppss:: iinnvviiss''
              Suppress output.

       \\XX''ppss:: eennddiinnvviiss''
              Stop suppressing output.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc ggssaavvee ccuurrrreennttppooiinntt 22 ccooppyy ttrraannssllaattee _n rroottaattee nneegg  eexxcchh  nneegg
       eexxcchh ttrraannssllaattee''
              where  _n is the angle of rotation.  This is to support the _a_l_i_g_n
              command in ggppiicc.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc ggrreessttoorree''
              Again used by ggppiicc to restore after rotation.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc _n sseettlliinneejjooiinn''
              where _n can be one of the following values.

              0 = Miter join
              1 = Round join
              2 = Bevel join

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc _n sseettlliinneeccaapp''
              where _n can be one of the following values.

              0 = Butt cap
              1 = Round cap, and
              2 = Projecting square cap

       \\XX''ppss:: ...... ppddffmmaarrkk''
              All the _p_d_f_m_a_r_k macros installed by using _-_m _p_d_f_m_a_r_k or _-_m _m_s_p_d_f
              (see  documentation  in  _p_d_f_m_a_r_k_._p_d_f).  A subset of these macros
              are installed automatically when you use --TTppddff so you should not
              need  to  use `-m pdfmark' for using most of the PDF functional-
              ity.

       ggrrooppddff  also  supports  a  subset  of  the   commands   introduced   in
       present.tmac.  Specifically it supports:-

              PAUSE
              BLOCKS
              BLOCKE

       Which  allows  you to create presentation type PDFs.  Many of the other
       commands are already available in other macro packages.

       These commands are implemented with ggrrooffff X commands:-

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc %%%%%%%%PPAAUUSSEE
              The section before this is treated as a block and is  introduced
              using  the  current  BLOCK transition setting (see `pdf: transi-
              tion' below).  This command can be introduced  using  the  macro
              ..ppddffppaauussee.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc %%%%%%%%BBEEGGIINNOONNCCEE
              Any  text  following  this  command (up to %%%%ENDONCE) is shown
              only once, the next %%%%PAUSE will remove it.   If  producing  a
              non   presentation   pdf,   i.e.   ignoring   the   pauses,  see
              _G_R_O_P_D_F___N_O_S_L_I_D_E below, this text is ignored.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc %%%%%%%%EENNDDOONNCCEE
              This terminates the block defined by %%%%BEGINONCE.   This  pair
              of commands is what implements the .BLOCKS Once/.BLOCKE commands
              in present.tmac.

       The mmoomm macro set already has integration with these extensions so  you
       can build slides with mmoomm.

       If you use present.tmac with ggrrooppddff there is no need to run the program
       pprreesseennttppss(1) since the output will already be a presentation pdf.

       All other ppss:: tags are silently ignored.

       One \\XX special used by the DVI driver is also recognised:

       \\XX''ppaappeerrssiizzee==_p_a_p_e_r_-_s_i_z_e''
              where the _p_a_p_e_r_-_s_i_z_e parameter is the same as the ppaappeerrssiizzee com-
              mand.   See  ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for details.  This means that you can
              alter the page size at will within the PDF file being created by
              ggrrooppddff.   If  you  do  want to change the paper size, it must be
              done before you start creating the page.

       In addition, ggrrooppddff supports its own suite of ppddff:: tags.  The following
       tags are supported:

       \\XX''ppddff:: ppddffppiicc _f_i_l_e _a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t _w_i_d_t_h _h_e_i_g_h_t _l_i_n_e_-_l_e_n_g_t_h''
              Place an image of the specified _w_i_d_t_h containing the PDF drawing
              from file _f_i_l_e of desired _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t (if _h_e_i_g_h_t is missing
              or  zero  then it is scaled proportionally).  If _a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t is --LL
              the drawing is left aligned.  If it is --CC  or  --RR  a  _l_i_n_e_l_e_n_g_t_h
              greater  than  the width of the drawing is required as well.  If
              _w_i_d_t_h is specified as zero then the width is scaled  in  propor-
              tion to the height.

       \\XX''ppddff:: xxrreevv''
              This  toggles  a  flag  which reverses the direction of printing
              _l_e_t_t_e_r _b_y _l_e_t_t_e_r, i.e., each separate letter  is  reversed,  not
              the  entire word.  This is useful for reversing the direction of
              glyphs in the Dingbats  font.   To  return  to  normal  printing
              repeat the command again.

              If you are using page traps to produce headings, footings, etc.,
              you need to use these in case a `hot spot' crosses a page bound-
              ary,  otherwise  any text output by the heading or footing macro
              will be marked as part of the `hot spot'.  To stop this  happen-
              ing  just  place  `.pdfmarksuspend' and `.pdfmarkrestart' at the
              start and end of the page trap macro, respectively.  (These  are
              just  convenience  macros  which emit the \X code.  These macros
              must only be used within page traps.)

              where

              _f_e_a_t_u_r_e  can  be  either  SLIDE  or BLOCK.  When it is SLIDE the
              transition is used when a new slide is introduced to the screen,
              if  BLOCK then this transition is used for the individual blocks
              which make up the slide.
              _m_o_d_e is the transition type between slides:-

                     SSpplliitt - Two lines sweep across the screen, revealing  the
                     new page.  The lines may be either horizontal or vertical
                     and may move inward from the edges of the page or outward
                     from the center, as specified by the _d_i_m_e_n_s_i_o_n and _m_o_t_i_o_n
                     entries, respectively.
                     BBlliinnddss - Multiple lines, evenly spaced across the screen,
                     synchronously  sweep  in the same direction to reveal the
                     new page.  The lines may be either horizontal  or  verti-
                     cal, as specified by the _d_i_m_e_n_s_i_o_n
                      entry.   Horizontal  lines move downward; vertical lines
                     move to the right.
                     BBooxx - A rectangular box sweeps inward from the  edges  of
                     the  page or outward from the center, as specified by the
                     _m_o_t_i_o_n entry, revealing the new page.
                     WWiippee - A single line sweeps across the  screen  from  one
                     edge  to  the  other  in  the  direction specified by the
                     _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n entry, revealing the new page.
                     DDiissssoollvvee - The old page dissolves gradually to reveal the
                     new one.
                     GGlliitttteerr  -  Similar  to  Dissolve, except that the effect
                     sweeps across the page in a wide  band  moving  from  one
                     side  of  the screen to the other in the direction speci-
                     fied by the _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n entry.
                     RR - The new page simply replaces the old one with no spe-
                     cial  transition  effect;  the  _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  entry shall be
                     ignored.
                     FFllyy - (PDF 1.5) Changes are flown out or in (as specified
                     by  _m_o_t_i_o_n),  in the direction specified by _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n, to
                     or from a location that is offscreen except  when  _d_i_r_e_c_-
                     _t_i_o_n is NNoonnee.
                     PPuusshh - (PDF 1.5) The old page slides off the screen while
                     the new page slides in, pushing the old page out  in  the
                     direction specified by _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n.
                     CCoovveerr - (PDF 1.5) The new page slides on to the screen in
                     the direction specified by _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n,  covering  the  old
                     page.
                     UUnnccoovveerr - (PDF 1.5) The old page slides off the screen in
                     the direction specified by _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n, uncovering the  new
                     page in the direction specified by _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n.
                     FFaaddee  -  (PDF 1.5) The new page gradually becomes visible
                     through the old one.

              _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n is the length of the transition in seconds (default 1).

              _d_i_m_e_n_s_i_o_n (Optional; SSpplliitt and BBlliinnddss  transition  styles  only)
              The  dimension  in  which  the specified transition effect shall
              occur: HH Horizontal, or VV Vertical.

              _m_o_t_i_o_n (Optional; SSpplliitt, BBooxx and FFllyy transition styles only) The
              direction  of  motion  for  the  specified  transition effect: II
              Inward from the edges of the page, or OO Outward from the  center
              of the page.

              _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n (Optional; WWiippee, GGlliitttteerr, FFllyy, CCoovveerr, UUnnccoovveerr and PPuusshh
              transition styles only) The direction  in  which  the  specified
              transition  effect  shall  moves,  expressed in degrees counter-
              clockwise starting from a left-to-right direction.  If the value
              is  a number, it shall be one of: 00 = Left to right, 9900 = Bottom
              to top (Wipe only), 118800 = Right to left (Wipe only), 227700  =  Top
              to  bottom,  331155  =  Top-left to bottom-right (Glitter only) The
              value can be NNoonnee, which is relevant only for the FFllyy transition
              when the value of _s_c_a_l_e is not 1.0.

              _s_c_a_l_e  (Optional; PDF 1.5; FFllyy transition style only) The start-
              ing or ending scale at which the changes  shall  be  drawn.   If
              _m_o_t_i_o_n  specifies an inward transition, the scale of the changes
              drawn shall progress from _s_c_a_l_e to 1.0 over the  course  of  the
              transition.   If  _m_o_t_i_o_n  specifies  an  outward transition, the
              scale of the changes drawn shall progress from 1.0 to _s_c_a_l_e over
              the course of the transition

              _b_o_o_l (Optional; PDF 1.5; FFllyy transition style only) If ttrruuee, the
              area that shall be flown in is rectangular and opaque.

              This command can be used by  calling  the  macro  ..ppddffttrraannssiittiioonn
              using the parameters described above.  Any of the parameters may
              be replaced with a "." which signifies the parameter retains its
              previous   value,  also  any  trailing  missing  parameters  are
              ignored.

              NNoottee:: not all PDF Readers support any or all these transitions.

   IImmppoorrttiinngg ggrraapphhiiccss
       ggrrooppddff only supports importing other PDF files as graphics.   But  that
       PDF  file  may  contain any of the graphic formats supported by the PDF
       standard (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.).  So any application which out-
       puts  PDF  can be used as an embedded file in ggrrooppddff.  The PDF file you
       wish to insert must be a single page and  the  drawing  must  just  fit
       inside  the  media size of the PDF file.  So, in iinnkkssccaappee(1) or ggiimmpp(1)
       (for example) make sure the canvas size just fits the image.

       The PDF parser used in ggrrooppddff has not been rigorously tested  with  all
       possible  applications  which  produce PDFs.  If you find a single page
       PDF which fails to import properly, it is worth running it through  the
       ppddffttkk(1) program by issuing the command:

              ppddffttkk _o_l_d_f_i_l_e_._p_d_f oouuttppuutt _n_e_w_f_i_l_e_._p_d_f

       You may find that _n_e_w_f_i_l_e_._p_d_f will now load successfully.

       ggrrooppddff  does  not  support  any other fonts except Adobe Type 1 (PFA or
       PFB).

FFOONNTT IINNSSTTAALLLLAATTIIOONN
       This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it can serve as
       a step-by-step font installation guide for ggrrooppddff.

        +o  Convert your font to something groff understands.  This is either a
           PostScript Type 1 font in either PFA or PFB, together with  an  AFM
           file.

           The very first line in a PFA/PFB file contains this:

                  %%!!PPSS--AAddoobbeeFFoonntt--11..00::

           A  PFB file has this also in the first line, but the string is pre-
           ceded with some binary bytes.

        +o  Convert the AFM file to a groff  font  description  file  with  the
           aaffmmttooddiitt(1) program.  An example call is

                  afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm map/textmap FBB

           which converts the metric file `Foo-Bar-Bold.afm' to the groff font
           `FBB'.  If you have a font family which comes  with  normal,  bold,
           italic, and bold italic faces, it is recommended to use the letters
           RR, BB, II, and BBII, respectively, as postfixes in the groff font names
           to  make groff's `.fam' request work.  An example is groff's built-
           in Times-Roman font: The font family name is TT, and the groff  font
           names are TTRR, TTBB, TTII, and TTBBII.

        +o  Install  both  the  groff font description files and the fonts in a
           `devpdf' subdirectory of the font path which groff finds.  See sec-
           tion  "Environment"  in  ttrrooffff(1)  for the actual value of the font
           path.  Note that groff doesn't use the AFM files (but it is a  good
           idea to store them anyway).

        +o  Register  all  fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the
           _d_e_v_p_d_f_/_d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file.  Only the first occurrence of  this  file  in
           the font path is read.  This means that you should copy the default
           _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file to the first directory in your font path and add your
           fonts  there.   To continue the above example we assume that the PS
           font name for Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa is `XY-Foo-Bar-Bold'  (the  PS  font
           name  is  stored  in  the  iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee  field in the _F_B_B file) and
           belongs to foundry `F' thus the following line should be  added  to
           _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d:

                  FF XXYY--FFoooo--BBaarr--BBoolldd FFoooo--BBaarr--BBoolldd..ppffaa

           Use a tab character to separate the fields, and the `foundry' field
           should be null for the default foundry.

              the font file has been specified with a full path,  no  directo-
              ries  are  searched.   See  ttrrooffff(1)  and ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for more
