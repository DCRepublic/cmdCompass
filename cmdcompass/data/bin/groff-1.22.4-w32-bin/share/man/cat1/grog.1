DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggrroogg reads the input (file names or standard input) and  guesses  which
       of  the ggrrooffff(1) options are needed to perform the input with the ggrrooffff
       program.  A suitable device is now always written as --TT_d_e_v_i_c_e including
       the groff default as --TT ppss.

       The  corresponding  ggrrooffff command is usually displayed in standard out-
       put.  With the option ----rruunn, the generated line is output into standard
       error  and  the  generated ggrrooffff command is run on the _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _o_u_t_p_u_t.
       ggrrooffffeerr(1) relies on a perfectly running ggrrooffff(1).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The option --vv or ----vveerrssiioonn prints information on  the  version  number.
       Also  --hh  or  ----hheellpp  prints  usage information.  Both of these options
       automatically end the ggrroogg program.  Other options are thenignored, and
       no  ggrrooffff  command  line is generated.  The following 3 options are the
       only ggrroogg options,

       --CC     this option means enabling the _g_r_o_f_f compatibility  mode,  which
              is also transfered to the generated ggrrooffff command line.

       ----lliiggaattuurreess
              this  option forces to include the arguments --PP--yy --PPUU within the
              generated ggrrooffff command line.

       ----rruunn  with this option, the command line is output at  standard  error
              and then run on the computer.

       ----wwaarrnniinnggss
              with  this  option,  some  more  warnings are output to standard
              error.

       All other specified short options (words starting with one minus  char-
       acter  --)  are  interpreted as ggrrooffff options or option clusters with or
       without argument.  No space is allowed between options and their  argu-
       ment.   Except  from  the --mm_a_r_g options, all options will be passed on,
       i.e. they are included unchanged in the command for the output  without
       effecting the work of ggrroogg.

       A  _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  argument  can  either be the name of an existing file or a
       single minus -- to mean standard input.  If  no  _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  is  specified
       standard input is read automatically.

DDEETTAAIILLSS
       ggrroogg reads all _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters as a whole.  It tries to guess which
       of the following ggrrooffff options are required for running the input under
       ggrrooffff: --ee, --gg, --GG, --jj, --pp, --RR, --ss, --tt (preprocessors); and --mmaann, --mmddoocc,
       --mmddoocc--oolldd, --mmee, --mmmm, --mmoomm, and --mmss (macro packages).

       The guessed ggrrooffff command including those options and the  found  _f_i_l_e_-
       _s_p_e_c parameters is put on the standard output.

       It  is possible to specify arbitrary ggrrooffff options on the command line.
       These are passed on the output without change,  except  for  the  --mm_a_r_g
       options.

       The ggrrooffff program has trouble when the wrong --mm_a_r_g option or several of
       these options are specified.  In these cases, ggrroogg will print an  error
       message  and exit with an error code.  It is better to specify no --mm_a_r_g
       option.  Because such an option is only accepted and passed  when  ggrroogg
       does not find any of these options or the same option is found.

       If  several  different --mm_a_r_g options are found by ggrroogg an error message
       is produced and the program is terminated with an error code.  But  the
       output is written with the wrong options nevertheless.

       Remember that it is not necessary to determine a macro package.  A _r_o_f_f
       file can also be written in the _g_r_o_f_f language without any macro  pack-
       age.  ggrroogg will produce an output without an --mm_a_r_g option.

       As  ggrrooffff  also  works  with pure text files without any _r_o_f_f requests,
       ggrroogg cannot be used to identify a file to be a _r_o_f_f file.

       The ggrrooffffeerr(1) program heavily depends on a working ggrroogg.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Calling
              grog meintro.me
       results in
              groff -me meintro.me
       So ggrroogg recognized that the file mmeeiinnttrroo..mmee is  written  with  the  --mmee
       macro package.
       On the other hand,
              grog pic.ms
       outputs
              groff -p -t -e -ms pic.ms
       Besides  determining  the  macro  package --mmss, ggrroogg recognized that the
       file ppiicc..mmss additionally needs --ppttee, the combination of --pp for _p_i_c,  --tt
       for _t_b_l, and --ee for _e_q_n.
       If both of the former example files are combined by the command
              grog meintro.me pic.ms
       an  error  message  is sent to standard error because ggrrooffff cannot work
       with two different macro packages:
              grog: error: there are several macro packages: -me -ms
       Additionally the corresponding output with the wrong options is printed
       to standard output:
              groff -pte -me -ms meintro.me pic.ms
       But the program is terminated with an error code.  The call of
              grog -ksS -Tdvi grnexmpl.g
       contains several ggrrooffff options that are just passed on the output with-
       out any interface to ggrroogg.  These are the option cluster --kkssSS  consist-
       ing of --kk, --ss, and --SS; and the option --TT with argument ddvvii.  The output
       is
              groff -k -s -S -Tdvi grnexmpl.g
       so no additional option was added by ggrroogg.   As  no  option  --mm_a_r_g  was
       found by ggrroogg this file does not use a macro package.

       ggrroogg was originally written by James Clark.  The current Perl implemen-
       tation was written by Bernd Warken <groff-bernd.warken-72@web.de>  with
       contributions  from Ralph Corderoy, and is maintained by Werner Lemberg
