DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ggrrooffffeerr program is the easiest way to use ggrrooffff(1).  It can display
       arbitrary  documents  written  in  the _g_r_o_f_f language, see ggrrooffff(7), or
       other _r_o_f_f languages, see rrooffff(7), that are compatible to the  original
       _t_r_o_f_f  language.   It finds and runs all necessary _g_r_o_f_f preprocessors,
       such as cchheemm.

       The ggrrooffffeerr program also includes many of the features for finding  and
       displaying  the Unix manual pages (_m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s), such that it can be used
       as a replacement for a mmaann(1) program.  Moreover, compressed files that
       can be handled by ggzziipp(1) or bbzziipp22(1) are decompressed on-the-fly.

       The  normal usage is quite simple by supplying a file name or name of a
       _m_a_n _p_a_g_e without further options.  But the  option  handling  has  many
       possibilities  for creating special behaviors.  This can be done either
       in  configuration  files,   with   the   shell   environment   variable
       _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T, or on the command line.

       The output can be generated and viewed in several different ways avail-
       able for _g_r_o_f_f.  This includes the X Window System-based _g_r_o_f_f  program
       ggxxddiittvviieeww(1),  each  _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t,  _P_D_F,  or  _D_V_I  display program, a web
       browser by generating _H_T_M_L or _X_H_T_M_L in _w_w_w _m_o_d_e, or several _t_e_x_t  _m_o_d_e_s
       in text terminals.

       Most  of the options that must be named when running ggrrooffff directly are
       determined automatically for ggrrooffffeerr, due to the internal usage of  the
       ggrroogg(1)  program.  But all parts can also be controlled manually by ar-
       guments.

       Several file names can be  specified  on  the  command-line  arguments.
       They are transformed into a single document in the normal way of ggrrooffff.

       Option  handling  is  done in GNU style.  Options and file names can be
       mixed freely.  The option "----" closes the option handling, all  follow-
       ing  arguments are treated as file names.  Long options can be abbrevi-
       ated in several ways.

              The _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters are all arguments that  are  neither  an
              option nor an option argument.  They usually mean a file name or
              a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e searching scheme.

              In the following, the term _s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is used.  It  means
              a  word  that  consists of a _m_a_n _s_e_c_t_i_o_n that is optionally fol-
              lowed by an _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.  The name of a _m_a_n _s_e_c_t_i_o_n  is  a  single
              character  from [[11--99oonn]], the _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is some word.  The _e_x_t_e_n_-
              _s_i_o_n is mostly lacking.

              No _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters means standard input.

              --         stands for standard input (can occur several times).

OOPPTTIIOONN DDEETTAAIILLSS
       The ggrrooffffeerr program can usually be run with very few options.  But  for
       special purposes, it supports many options.  These can be classified in
       5 option classes.

       All short options of ggrrooffffeerr are compatible with the short  options  of
       ggrrooffff(1).   All  long  options  of ggrrooffffeerr are compatible with the long
       options of mmaann(1).

       Arguments for long option names can be  abbreviated  in  several  ways.
       First, the argument is checked whether it can be prolonged as is.  Fur-
       thermore, each minus sign -- is considered as a starting point for a new
       abbreviation.  This leads to a set of multiple abbreviations for a sin-
       gle argument.  For example, ----ddee--nn--ff can be used as an abbreviation for
       ----ddeebbuugg--nnoott--ffuunncc, but ----ddee--nn works as well.  If the abbreviation of the
       argument leads to several resulting options an error is raised.

       These abbreviations  are  only  allowed  in  the  environment  variable
       _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T, but not in the configuration files.  In configuration, all
       long options must be exact.

   ggrrooffffeerr bbrreeaakkiinngg OOppttiioonnss
       As soon as one of these options is found on the command line it is exe-
       cuted,  printed  to  standard output, and the running ggrrooffffeerr is termi-
       nated thereafter.  All other arguments are ignored.

       --hh | ----hheellpp
              Print help information with a short explanation  of  options  to
              standard output.

       --vv | ----vveerrssiioonn
              Print version information to standard output.

       The  display  mode  and  the  viewer  programs  are determined by these
       options.  If none of these mode and viewer options is specified ggrrooffffeerr
       tries to find a suitable display mode automatically.  The default modes
       are _m_o_d_e _p_d_f, _m_o_d_e _p_s, _m_o_d_e _h_t_m_l, _m_o_d_e _x_h_t_m_l, _m_o_d_e _x, and _m_o_d_e  _d_v_i  in
       the  X  Window  System  with different viewers and _m_o_d_e _t_t_y with device
       _u_t_f_8 under lleessss on a terminal; other modes are tested if  the  programs
       for the main default mode do not exist.

       In  the  X  Window  System,  many programs create their own window when
       called.  ggrrooffffeerr can run these viewers as an independent program in the
       background.   As  this  does  not work in text mode on a terminal (tty)
       there must be a way to know which viewers  are  X  Window  System-based
       graphical  programs.  The ggrrooffffeerr script has a small amount of informa-
       tion on some viewer names.  If a viewer argument  of  the  command-line
       chooses  an element that is recognized as an X Window System-based pro-
       gram in this list, it is treated as a viewer that can run in the  back-
       ground.  Unrecognized viewers are not run in the background.

       For  each  mode, you are free to choose whatever viewer you want.  That
       need not be some graphical viewer suitable for this mode.  There  is  a
       chance  to  view the output source; for example, the combination of the
       options ----mmooddee==ppss and ----vviieewweerr==lleessss shows the content of the _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t
       output, the source code, with the pager lleessss.

       ----ddeeffaauulltt
              Reset  all  configuration from previously processed command-line
              options to the default values.  This is useful to wipe  out  all
              former options of the configuration, in _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T, and restart
              option processing using only the rest of the command line.

       ----ddvvii  Equivalent  to  ----mmooddee==ddvvii.   Known _D_V_I viewers for the X Window
              System include xxddvvii(1) and ddvviillxx(1).

       ----ggrrooffff
              Equivalent to ----mmooddee==ggrrooffff.

       ----hhttmmll Equivalent to ----mmooddee==hhttmmll.

       ----mmooddee _v_a_l_u_e
              Set the display mode.  The following mode values are recognized:

              aauuttoo   Select the automatic determination of the  display  mode.
                     The  sequence of modes that are tried can be set with the
                     ----ddeeffaauulltt--mmooddeess  option.   Useful   for   restoring   the
                     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _m_o_d_e when a different mode was specified before.

              ddvvii    Display  formatted  input  in  a  _D_V_I viewer program.  By
                     default,  the  formatted  input  is  displayed  with  the
                     xxddvvii(1) program.

              ggrrooffff  After  the  file determination, switch ggrrooffffeerr to process
                     the input like ggrrooffff(1)  would  do.   This  disables  the
                     _g_r_o_f_f_e_r viewing features.

              hhttmmll   Translate  the  input  into  HTML  format and display the
                     result in a web browser program.  By default,  the  exis-
                     tence  of  a sequence of standard web browsers is tested,
                     starting with kkoonnqquueerroorr(1) and mmoozziillllaa(1).  The text HTML
                     viewer  is  llyynnxx(1).   By  default,  the  existence  of a
                     sequence of standard web  browsers  is  tested,  starting
                     with  kkoonnqquueerroorr(1)  and mmoozziillllaa(1).  The text HTML viewer
                     is llyynnxx(1).

              ppddff    Transform _r_o_f_f _i_n_p_u_t _f_i_l_e_s into a _P_D_F _f_i_l_e by  using  the
                     ggrrooffff  ((11)) device --TTppddff.  This is the default PPDDFF genera-
                     tor.  The generated _P_D_F _f_i_l_e is displayed  with  suitable
                     viewer programs, such as ookkuullaarr(1).

              ppddff22   This  is  the  traditional _p_d_f _m_o_d_e.  Sometimes this mode
                     produces more correct output than the default  PPDDFF  mmooddee.
                     By  default,  the  input  is formatted by ggrrooffff using the
                     PostScript device, then it is transformed  into  the  PDF
                     file  format  using  ggss(1),  or ppss22ppddff(1).  If that's not
                     possible, the  _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t  _m_o_d_e  _(_p_s_)  is  used  instead.
                     Finally it is displayed using different viewer programs.

              ppss     Display  formatted  input in a PostScript viewer program.
                     By default, the formatted input is displayed  in  one  of
                     many viewer programs.

              tteexxtt   Format in a _g_r_o_f_f _t_e_x_t _m_o_d_e and write the result to stan-
                     dard output without a pager or viewer program.  The  text
                     device, _l_a_t_i_n_1 by default, can be chosen with option --TT.

              ttttyy    Format in a _g_r_o_f_f _t_e_x_t _m_o_d_e and write the result to stan-
                     dard output using a text pager program, even when in  the
                     X Window System.

              wwwwww    Equivalent to ----mmooddee==hhttmmll.

              xx      Display  the formatted input in a native _r_o_f_f viewer.  By
                     default,  the  formatted  input  is  displayed  with  the
                     ggxxddiittvviieeww(1)  program  being  distributed  together  with
                     ggrrooffff.   But  the  legacy  X  Window  System  application
                     xxddiittvviieeww(1)  can also be chosen with the option ----vviieewweerr.
                     The default resolution is 7755ddppii, but 110000ddppii are also pos-
                     sible.   The  default  _g_r_o_f_f device for the resolution of
                     7755ddppii is XX7755--1122, for 110000ddppii it is XX110000.  The  correspond-
                     ing  _g_r_o_f_f  _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e  _o_u_t_p_u_t for the actual device is
                     generated and the result is displayed.  For a  resolution
                     of  110000ddppii, the default width of the geometry of the dis-
                     play program is chosen to 885500ddppii.

              XX      Equivalent to ----mmooddee==xx.

              xxhhttmmll  Translate the input into _X_H_T_M_L format, which  is  an  _X_M_L
                     version  of  _H_T_M_L.   Then  display  the  result  in a web
                     browser program, mostly the known _H_T_M_L _v_i_e_w_e_r_s.

              The following modes do not use  the  _g_r_o_f_f_e_r  viewing  features.
              They are only interesting for advanced applications.

              ggrrooffff  Generate device output with plain _g_r_o_f_f without using the
                     special viewing features of _g_r_o_f_f_e_r.  If  no  device  was
                     specified by option --TT the _g_r_o_f_f default ppss is assumed.

              ssoouurrccee Output  the  roff  source code of the input files without
                     further processing.

       ----ppddff  Equivalent to ----mmooddee==ppddff.
       ----ppddff22 Equivalent to ----mmooddee==ppddff22.

       ----ppss   Equivalent to  ----mmooddee==ppss.   Common  PostScript  viewers  include
              ookkuullaarr(1),  eevviinnccee(1),  ggvv(1),  gghhoossttvviieeww(1), and ggss(1), In each
              case, arguments can be provided additionally.

       ----ssoouurrccee
              Equivalent to ----mmooddee==ssoouurrccee.

       ----tteexxtt Equivalent to ----mmooddee==tteexxtt.

       ----ttoo--ssttddoouutt
              The file for the chosen mode is generated  and  its  content  is
              printed to standard output.  It will not be displayed in graphi-
              cal mode.

       ----ttttyy  Equivalent to ----mmooddee==ttttyy.  The standard pager is lleessss(1).   This
              option  is  equivalent  to  _m_a_n option ----ppaaggeerr==_p_r_o_g.  The option
              argument can be a file name or  a  program  to  be  searched  in
              _$_P_A_T_H; arguments can be provided additionally.

       ----vviieewweerr _p_r_o_g
              Choose  a viewer program for actual device or mode.  This can be
              a file name or a program to be searched in _$_P_A_T_H; arguments  can
              be provided additionally.

       ----wwwwww  Equivalent to ----mmooddee==hhttmmll.

       ----XX | ----xx
              Equivalent   to   ----mmooddee==xx.    Suitable   viewer   programs  are
              ggxxddiittvviieeww(1) which is the default and xxddiittvviieeww(1).

       ----     Signals the end of option processing;  all  remaining  arguments
              are interpreted as _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters.

       Besides these, ggrrooffffeerr accepts all short options that are valid for the
       ggrrooffff(1) program.  All non-ggrrooffffeerr options are sent unmodified via ggrroogg
       to  ggrrooffff.  So postprocessors, macro packages, compatibility with _c_l_a_s_-
       _s_i_c_a_l _t_r_o_f_f, and much more can be manually specified.

   OOppttiioonnss rreellaatteedd ttoo ggrrooffff
       All short options of ggrrooffffeerr are compatible with the short  options  of
       ggrrooffff(1).   The  following  of  ggrrooffff options have either an additional
       special meaning within ggrrooffffeerr or make sense for normal usage.

       Because of the special outputting  behavior  of  the  ggrrooffff  option  --ZZ
       ggrrooffffeerr  was designed to be switched into _g_r_o_f_f _m_o_d_e; the _g_r_o_f_f_e_r view-
       ing features are disabled there.  The other ggrrooffff options do not switch
       the mode, but allow to customize the formatting process.

       ----aa    This   generates   an  ASCII  approximation  of  output  in  the
              _t_e_x_t _m_o_d_e_s.  That could be important when  the  text  pager  has
              problems with control sequences in _t_t_y _m_o_d_e.

       ----mm _f_i_l_e
              Add  _f_i_l_e as a _g_r_o_f_f macro file.  This is useful in case it can-
              not be recognized automatically.

       ----PP _o_p_t___o_r___a_r_g
              Send the argument _o_p_t___o_r___a_r_g as an option or option argument  to
              the actual ggrrooffff postprocessor.

       ----TT _d_e_v_n_a_m_e | ----ddeevviiccee _d_e_v_n_a_m_e
              This  option  determines ggrrooffff's output device.  The most impor-
              tant devices are the text output devices for  referring  to  the
              different character sets, such as aasscciiii, uuttff88, llaattiinn11, uuttff88, and
              others.   Each  of  these  arguments  switches  ggrrooffffeerr  into  a
              _t_e_x_t  _m_o_d_e  using this device, to _m_o_d_e _t_t_y if the actual mode is
              not a _t_e_x_t _m_o_d_e.  The following _d_e_v_n_a_m_e arguments are mapped  to
              the  corresponding  ggrrooffffeerr  ----mmooddee==_d_e_v_n_a_m_e  option:  ddvvii, hhttmmll,
              xxhhttmmll, and ppss.  All XX** arguments are mapped  to  _m_o_d_e  _x.   Each
              other _d_e_v_n_a_m_e argument switches to _m_o_d_e _g_r_o_f_f using this device.

       ----XX    is  equivalent  to ggrrooffff --XX.  It displays the _g_r_o_f_f _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e
              _o_u_t_p_u_t with ggxxddiittvviieeww.  As the quality is  relatively  bad  this
              option is deprecated; use ----XX instead because the _x _m_o_d_e uses an
              _X* device for a better display.

       --ZZ | ----iinntteerrmmeeddiiaattee--oouuttppuutt | ----ddiittrrooffff
              Switch into _g_r_o_f_f _m_o_d_e and  format  the  input  with  the  _g_r_o_f_f
              _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e  _o_u_t_p_u_t  without  postprocessing; see ggrrooffff__oouutt(5).
              This is equivalent to option ----ddiittrrooffff of _m_a_n, which can be used
              as well.

       All  other  ggrrooffff  options  are supported by ggrrooffffeerr, but they are just
       transparently transferred  to  ggrrooffff  without  any  intervention.   The
       options  that  are  not explicitly handled by ggrrooffffeerr are transparently
       passed to ggrrooffff.  Therefore these transparent  options  are  not  docu-
       mented  here,  but in ggrrooffff(1).  Due to the automatism in ggrrooffffeerr, none
       of these ggrrooffff options should be needed, except for advanced usage.

   OOppttiioonnss ffoorr mmaann ppaaggeess
       ----aapprrooppooss
              Start the aapprrooppooss(1) command or facility of mmaann(1) for searching
              the  _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  arguments within all _m_a_n _p_a_g_e descriptions.  Each
              _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c argument is taken for search as it is; _s_e_c_t_i_o_n specific
              parts  are  not  handled, such that 77 ggrrooffff searches for the two
              arguments 77 and ggrrooffff, with a large  result;  for  the  _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c
              ggrrooffff..77  nothing  will be found.  The _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e locale is handled
              only when the called programs do support this; the  GNU  aapprrooppooss
              and mmaann --kk do not.  The display differs from the aapprrooppooss program
              by the following concepts:

              * Construct a _g_r_o_f_f frame similar to a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e to the output of

              * each _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c argument is searched on its own.

              * The restriction by ----sseeccttiioonnss is handled as well,

              * wildcard  characters are allowed and handled without a further

              Show only the aapprrooppooss descriptions for  documents  on  programs,
              these  are the mmaann(7) _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s _1, _6, and _8.  Direct _s_e_c_t_i_o_n dec-
              larations are ignored, wildcards are accepted.

       ----wwhhaattiiss
              For each _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c argument search  all  _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s  and  display
              their  description -- or say that it is not a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e.  This is
              written from anew, so it differs from _m_a_n's wwhhaattiiss output by the
              following concepts

              * each retrieved file name is added,

              * local files are handled as well,

              * the _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e and _s_y_s_t_e_m locale is supported,

              * the  display  is  framed by a _g_r_o_f_f output format similar to a
                _m_a_n _p_a_g_e,

              * wildcard characters are allowed without a further option.

       The following options were added to ggrrooffffeerr for  choosing  whether  the
       file  name  arguments  are interpreted as names for local files or as a
       search pattern for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.  The default  is  looking  up  for  local
       files.

       ----mmaann  Check the non-option command-line arguments (_f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c_s) first on
              being _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s, then whether they represent an  existing  file.
              By default, a _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c is first tested whether it is an existing
              file.

       ----nnoo--mmaann | ----llooccaall--ffiillee
              Do not check for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.  ----llooccaall--ffiillee is  the  corresponding
              mmaann option.

       ----nnoo--ssppeecciiaall
              Disable former calls of ----aallll, ----aapprrooppooss**, and ----wwhhaattiiss.

       The  long options of ggrrooffffeerr were synchronized with the long options of
       GNU mmaann.  All long options of GNU mmaann are recognized, but  not  all  of
       these  options  are  important to ggrrooffffeerr, so most of them are just ig-
       nored.  These ignored mmaann options are ----ccaattmmaann, ----ttrrooffff, and ----uuppddaattee.

       In the following, the mmaann options  that  have  a  special  meaning  for
       ggrrooffffeerr are documented.

       If your system has GNU mmaann installed the full set of long and short op-
       tions of the GNU mmaann program can be passed via the environment variable
       _M_A_N_O_P_T; see mmaann(1).

       ----aallll  In  searching _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s, retrieve all suitable documents instead
              of only one.

       --77 | ----aasscciiii
              In _t_e_x_t _m_o_d_e_s, display ASCII translation of  special  characters
              for   critical   environment.    This  is  equivalent  to  ggrrooffff
              --mmttttyy__cchhaarr; see ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5).

       ----ddiittrrooffff
              Produce  _g_r_o_f_f  _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e  _o_u_t_p_u_t.   This  is  equivalent  to
              ggrrooffffeerr --ZZ.

       ----eexxtteennssiioonn _s_u_f_f_i_x
              Restrict _m_a_n _p_a_g_e search to file names that have _s_u_f_f_i_x appended
              to their  section  element.   For  example,  in  the  file  name
              _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_m_a_n_/_m_a_n_3_/_t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o_._3_n_c_u_r_s_e_s_._g_z  the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e extension
              is _n_c_u_r_s_e_s.

       ----llooccaallee _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e
              Set the language for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.  This has the same  effect,  but
              overwrites _$_L_A_N_G.

       ----llooccaattiioonn
              Print the location of the retrieved files to standard error.

       ----nnoo--llooccaattiioonn
              Do  not  display  the location of retrieved files; this resets a
              former call to ----llooccaattiioonn.  This was added by ggrrooffffeerr.

       ----mmaannppaatthh _'_d_i_r_1_:_d_i_r_2_:_._._._'
              Use the specified search path for retrieving _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s  instead
              of  the  program  defaults.  If the argument is set to the empty
              string "" the search for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e is disabled.

       ----ppaaggeerr
              Set the pager program in _t_t_y _m_o_d_e; default is lleessss.  This can be
              set with ----vviieewweerr.

       ----sseeccttiioonnss _s_e_c_1_:_s_e_c_2_:_._._.
              Restrict searching for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s to the given _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s, a colon-
              separated list.

       ----ssyysstteemmss _s_y_s_1_,_s_y_s_2_,_._._.
              Search for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s for the given operating systems; the  argu-
              ment _s_y_s_t_e_m_s is a comma-separated list.

       ----wwhheerree
              Equivalent to ----llooccaattiioonn.

       The following long options were adapted from the corresponding X Window
       System Toolkit Intrinsics options.  ggrrooffffeerr will pass them to the actu-
       al viewer program if it is an X Window System program.  Otherwise these
       options are ignored.

       Unfortunately these options use the old style of  a  single  minus  for
       long  options.  For ggrrooffffeerr that was changed to the standard with using
       a double minus for long options, for example, ggrrooffffeerr uses  the  option
       ----ffoonntt for the X Window System Toolkit Intrinsics option --ffoonntt.

       See XX(7) and the manual _X _T_o_o_l_k_i_t _I_n_t_r_i_n_s_i_c_s _- _C _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e _I_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e for

              Set the background color of the viewer window.

       ----bbdd _p_i_x_e_l_s
              This is equivalent to ----bboorrddeerrccoolloorr.

       ----bbgg _c_o_l_o_r

       ----bbww _p_i_x_e_l_s
              This is equivalent to ----bboorrddeerrwwiiddtthh.

       ----bboorrddeerrccoolloorr _p_i_x_e_l_s
              Specifies the color of the border surrounding the viewer window.

       ----bboorrddeerrwwiiddtthh _p_i_x_e_l_s
              Specifies the width in pixels  of  the  border  surrounding  the
              viewer window.

       ----ddiissppllaayy _X_-_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
              Set  the  X  Window  System  display on which the viewer program
              shall be started.  See section "Display Names" in XX(7)  for  the
              syntax of the argument.

       ----ffoorreeggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r
              Set the foreground color of the viewer window.

       ----ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
              This is equivalent to ----ffoorreeggrroouunndd.

       ----ffnn _f_o_n_t___n_a_m_e
              This is equivalent to ----ffoonntt.

       ----ffoonntt _f_o_n_t___n_a_m_e
              Set  the  font  used by the viewer window.  The argument is an X
              Window System font name.

       ----fftt _f_o_n_t___n_a_m_e
              This is equivalent to ----ffoonntt.

       ----ggeeoommeettrryy _s_i_z_e___p_o_s
              Set the geometry of the display window, that means its size  and
              its starting position.  See section "Geometry Specifications" in
              XX(7) for the syntax of the argument.

       ----rreessoolluuttiioonn _v_a_l_u_e
              Set X Window System resolution in dpi (dots per  inch)  in  some
              viewer  programs.  The only supported dpi values are 7755 and 110000.
              Actually, the default resolution for ggrrooffffeerr is  set  to  7755ddppii.
              The resolution also sets the default device in _m_o_d_e _x.

       ----ddeebbuugg
              Enable  all debugging options ----ddeebbuugg--_t_y_p_e.  The temporary files
              are kept and not deleted, the ggrroogg output is printed,  the  name
              of  the temporary directory is printed, the displayed file names
              are printed, and the parameters are printed.

       ----ddeebbuugg--ffiilleennaammeess
              Print the names of the files and _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s that are displayed by
              ggrrooffffeerr.

       ----ddeebbuugg--ggrroogg
              Print the output of all ggrroogg commands.

       ----ddeebbuugg--kkeeeepp
              Enable two debugging informations.  Print the name of the tempo-
              rary directory and keep the temporary files, do not delete  them
              during the run of ggrrooffffeerr.

       ----ddeebbuugg--ppaarraammss
              Print  the parameters, as obtained from the configuration files,
              from _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T, and the command-line arguments.

       ----ddeebbuugg--ttmmppddiirr
              Print the name of the temporary directory.

       ----ddoo--nnootthhiinngg
              This is like ----vveerrssiioonn, but without the  output;  no  viewer  is
              started.  This makes only sense in development.

       ----pprriinntt==_t_e_x_t
              Just print the argument to standard error.  This is good for pa-
              rameter check.

       --VV     This is an advanced option for debugging only.  Instead of  dis-
              playing  the formatted input, a lot of _g_r_o_f_f_e_r specific informa-
              tion is printed to standard output:

              * the output file name in the temporary directory,

              * the display mode of the actual ggrrooffffeerr run,

              * the display program for viewing the output with its arguments,

              * the active parameters from the config files, the arguments  in
                _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T, and the arguments of the command line,

              * the pipeline that would be run by the ggrrooffff program, but with-
                out executing it.

       Other  useful  debugging  options  are  the   ggrrooffff   option   --ZZ   and
       ----mmooddee==ggrrooffff.

   FFiilleessppeecc AArrgguummeennttss
       A _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameter is an argument that is not an option or option ar-
       gument.  In ggrrooffffeerr, _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters are a file name or a  template
       for  searching  _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s.  These input sources are collected and com-
       posed into a single output file such as ggrrooffff does.

       The strange POSIX behavior to regard all  arguments  behind  the  first
       non-option argument as _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c arguments is ignored.  The GNU behavior
       to recognize options even when mixed with _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  arguments  is  used
       throughout.   But,  as usual, the double minus argument ---- ends the op-
       tion handling and interprets all following arguments as _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  argu-
       ments; so the POSIX behavior can be easily adopted.

       The  options  ----aapprrooppooss** have a special handling of _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c arguments.
       Each argument is taken as a search scheme of its own.   Also  a  regexp
       (regular expression) can be used in the filespec.  For example, ggrrooffffeerr
       ----aapprrooppooss ''^^ggrroo..ff$$'' searches ggrrooffff in the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e name, while  ggrrooffffeerr
       ----aapprrooppooss  ggrrooffff searches ggrrooffff somewhere in the name or description of
       the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.

       All other parts of _g_r_o_f_f_e_r, such as the normal display  or  the  output
       with  ----wwhhaattiiss  have  a different scheme for _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c_s.  No regular ex-
       pressions are used for the arguments.  The _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c arguments are  han-
       dled by the following scheme.

       It  is  necessary  to know that on each system the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s are sorted
       according to their content into several sections.   The  _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l  _m_a_n
       _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s  have  a  single-character name, either a digit from 11 to 99 or
       one of the characters nn or oo.

       This can optionally be followed by a string, the  so-called  _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.
       The  _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n  allows  the  storage of several _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s with the same
       name in the same _s_e_c_t_i_o_n.  But the _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is only rarely used;  usu-
       ally  it is omitted.  Then the _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_s are searched automatically by
       alphabet.

       In the following, we use the name _s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n  for  a  word  that
       consists of a single character _s_e_c_t_i_o_n name or a _s_e_c_t_i_o_n character that
       is followed by an _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.  Each _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameter can have  one  of
       the following forms in decreasing sequence.

       * No  _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  parameters means that ggrrooffffeerr waits for standard input.
         The minus option -- always stands for standard  input;  it  can  occur
         several  times.   If  you want to look up a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e called -- use the
         argument mmaann::--.

       * Next a _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c is tested whether it is the path name of an  existing
         file.   Otherwise  it  is  assumed  to  be  a searching pattern for a
         _m_a_n _p_a_g_e.

       * mmaann::_n_a_m_e((_s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n))_,              mmaann::_n_a_m_e.._s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_,
         _n_a_m_e((_s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n))_,   or   _n_a_m_e.._s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n   search   the
         man  page  _n_a_m_e  in   man   section   and   possibly   extension   of
         _s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.

       * Now  mmaann::_n_a_m_e  searches for a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e in the lowest _m_a_n _s_e_c_t_i_o_n that
         has a document called _n_a_m_e.

       * _s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n _n_a_m_e is a pattern of 2  arguments  that  originates
         from  a  strange  argument  parsing  of the mmaann program.  Again, this
         searches the man page _n_a_m_e with _s_e_c_t_i_o_n___e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n, a combination of a
         _s_e_c_t_i_o_n character optionally followed by an _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.

       * We are left with the argument _n_a_m_e which is not an existing file.  So
         this searches for the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e called _n_a_m_e in the lowest _m_a_n  _s_e_c_t_i_o_n
         that has a document for this name.

       Several  file  name arguments can be supplied.  They are mixed by ggrrooffff
       into a single document.  Note that the set of option arguments must fit
       to  all of these file arguments.  So they should have at least the same
       style of the _g_r_o_f_f language.

OOUUTTPPUUTT MMOODDEESS
       By default, the ggrrooffffeerr program collects all input into a single  file,
       formats it with the ggrrooffff program for a certain device, and then choos-
       es a suitable viewer program.  The device and viewer process in ggrrooffffeerr
       is  called a _m_o_d_e.  The mode and viewer of a running ggrrooffffeerr program is
       selected automatically, but the user can also choose it  with  options.
       The  modes are selected by option the arguments of ----mmooddee==_a_n_y_m_o_d_e.  Ad-
       ditionally, each of this argument can be specified as an option of  its
       own, such as aannyymmooddee.  Most of these modes have a viewer program, which
       can be chosen by the option ----vviieewweerr.

       Several different modes are offered: graphical modes for the  X  Window
       System,  _t_e_x_t  _m_o_d_e_s, and some direct _g_r_o_f_f _m_o_d_e_s for debugging and de-
       velopment.

       By default, ggrrooffffeerr first  tries  whether  _x  _m_o_d_e  is  possible,  then
       _p_s  _m_o_d_e,  and  finally  _t_t_y  _m_o_d_e.   This  mode  testing  sequence for
       _a_u_t_o _m_o_d_e can be changed by specifying a comma separated list of  modes
       with the option ----ddeeffaauulltt--mmooddeess..

       The  searching for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s and the decompression of the input are ac-
       tive in every mode.

   GGrraapphhiiccaall DDiissppllaayy MMooddeess
       The graphical display modes work mostly in the X Window System environ-
       ment  (or similar implementations within other windowing environments).
       The environment variable _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y and the option ----ddiissppllaayy are used  for
       specifying the X Window System display to be used.  If this environment
       variable is empty, ggrrooffffeerr assumes that the X Window System is not run-
       ning  and changes to a _t_e_x_t _m_o_d_e.  You can change this automatic behav-
       ior by the option ----ddeeffaauulltt--mmooddeess.

       Known viewers for the graphical display modes and their standard X Win-
       dow System viewer programs are

       * in a PDF viewer (_p_d_f _m_o_d_e)

       * in a web browser (_h_t_m_l, (_x_h_t_m_l, or _w_w_w _m_o_d_e)

       * in a PostScript viewer (_p_s _m_o_d_e)

       * X  Window System _r_o_f_f viewers such as ggxxddiittvviieeww(1) or xxddiittvviieeww(1) (in
         _x _m_o_d_e)

       * in a DVI viewer program (_d_v_i _m_o_d_e)

       The _p_d_f _m_o_d_e has a major advantage -- it is the only graphical  display
       mode  that  allows  searching for text within the viewer; this can be a
       really important feature.  Unfortunately, it takes some time to  trans-
       form  the  input into the PDF format, so it was not chosen as the major
       mode.

       These graphical viewers can be customized by options of  the  X  Window
       System  Toolkit Intrinsics.  But the ggrrooffffeerr options use a leading dou-
       ble minus instead of the single minus used by the X Window System Tool-
       kit Intrinsics.

   TTeexxtt mmooddeess
       There are two modes for text output, _m_o_d_e _t_e_x_t for plain output without
       a pager and _m_o_d_e _t_t_y for a text output on a text  terminal  using  some
       pager program.

       If  the  variable  _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y is not set or empty, ggrrooffffeerr assumes that it
       should use _t_t_y _m_o_d_e.

       In the actual implementation, the _g_r_o_f_f output device _l_a_t_i_n_1 is  chosen
       for  _t_e_x_t  _m_o_d_e_s.   This  can  be  changed  by  specifying option --TT or
       ----ddeevviiccee.

       The pager to be used can be specified by one of the options ----ppaaggeerr and
       ----vviieewweerr,  or by the environment variable _P_A_G_E_R.  If all of this is not
       used the lleessss(1) program with the option --rr  for  correctly  displaying
       control sequences is used as the default pager.

   SSppeecciiaall MMooddeess ffoorr DDeebbuuggggiinngg aanndd DDeevveellooppmmeenntt
       These modes use the _g_r_o_f_f_e_r file determination and decompression.  This
       is combined into a single input file that is fed  directly  into  ggrrooffff
       with  different strategy without the _g_r_o_f_f_e_r viewing facilities.  These
       modes are regarded as advanced, they are useful for debugging  and  de-
       velopment purposes.

       The _s_o_u_r_c_e _m_o_d_e with option ----ssoouurrccee just displays the decompressed in-
       put.

       Option ----ttoo--ssttddoouutt does not display in a graphical mode.  It just  gen-
       erates  the  file  for  the  chosen mode and then prints its content to
       standard output.

       The _g_r_o_f_f _m_o_d_e passes the input to ggrrooffff using only some  suitable  op-
       tions provided to ggrrooffffeerr.  This enables the user to save the generated
       output into a file or pipe it into another program.

       In _g_r_o_f_f _m_o_d_e, the option --ZZ disables post-processing,  thus  producing
       the  _g_r_o_f_f  _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _o_u_t_p_u_t.  In this mode, the input is formatted,
       but not postprocessed; see ggrrooffff__oouutt(5) for details.

       All ggrrooffff short options are supported by ggrrooffffeerr.

MMAANN PPAAGGEE SSEEAARRCCHHIINNGG
       The default behavior of ggrrooffffeerr is to first test whether a file parame-
       ter  represents a local file; if it is not an existing file name, it is
       assumed to represent the name of a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e.  The following options can
       be  used  to  determine whether the arguments should be handled as file
       name or _m_a_n _p_a_g_e arguments.

       ----mmaann  forces to interpret all file parameters as _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c_s for search-
              ing _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.

       ----nnoo--mmaann
       ----llooccaall--ffiillee
              disable the _m_a_n searching; so only local files are displayed.

       If  neither a local file nor a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e was retrieved for some file pa-
       rameter a warning is issued on standard error, but processing  is  con-
       tinued.

   SSeeaarrcchh AAllggoorriitthhmm
       Let us now assume that a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e should be searched.  The ggrrooffffeerr pro-
       gram provides a search facility for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.  All long  options,  all
       environment  variables, and most of the functionality of the GNU mmaann(1)
       program were implemented.  The search algorithm shall  determine  which
       file is displayed for a given _m_a_n _p_a_g_e.  The process can be modified by
       options and environment variables.

       The only _m_a_n action that is omitted in  ggrrooffffeerr  are  the  preformatted
       _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s,  also  called _c_a_t _p_a_g_e_s.  With the excellent performance of
       the actual computers, the preformatted _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s aren't  necessary  any
       longer.  Additionally, ggrrooffffeerr is a _r_o_f_f program; it wants to read _r_o_f_f
       source files and format them itself.

       The algorithm for retrieving the file for a _m_a_n _p_a_g_e needs first a  set
       of  directories.   This  set starts with the so-called _m_a_n _p_a_t_h that is
       modified later on by adding names of  _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g  _s_y_s_t_e_m  and  _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e.
       This  arising set is used for adding the section directories which con-
       tain the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e files.

       The _m_a_n _p_a_t_h is a list of directories that are separated by colon.   It
       is generated by the following methods.

       * The environment variable _M_A_N_P_A_T_H can be set.

       * It can be read from the arguments of the environment variable _M_A_N_O_P_T.

       * The _m_a_n _p_a_t_h can be manually specified by using the option ----mmaannppaatthh.
         An empty argument disables the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e searching.

       * When no _m_a_n _p_a_t_h was set the mmaannppaatthh(1) program is tried to determine
         one.

       * If  this does not work a reasonable default path from _$_P_A_T_H is deter-
         mined.

       We now have a starting set of directories.  The  first  way  to  change
       this  set  is  by adding names of _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _s_y_s_t_e_m_s.  This assumes that
       _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s for several _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _s_y_s_t_e_m_s are installed.  This is not al-
       ways  true.   The  names of such _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _s_y_s_t_e_m_s can be provided by 3
       methods.

       * The environment variable _S_Y_S_T_E_M has the lowest precedence.

       * This can be overridden by an option in _M_A_N_O_P_T.

       * This again is overridden by the command-line option ----ssyysstteemmss.

       Several names of _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _s_y_s_t_e_m_s can  be  given  by  appending  their
       names, separated by a comma.

       The  _m_a_n  _p_a_t_h is changed by appending each _s_y_s_t_e_m name as subdirectory
       at the end of each directory of the set.  No directory of the _m_a_n  _p_a_t_h
       set  is  kept.  But if no _s_y_s_t_e_m name is specified the _m_a_n _p_a_t_h is left
       unchanged.

       After this, the actual set of directories can be  changed  by  _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e
       information.  This assumes that there exist _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s in different lan-
       guages.  The wanted _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e can be chosen by several methods.

       * Environment variable _L_A_N_G.

       * This is overridden by _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S.

       * This is overridden by _L_C___A_L_L.

       * This can be overridden by providing an option in _M_A_N_O_P_T.

       * All these environment variables are overridden  by  the  command-line
         option ----llooccaallee.

       The  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e can be specified by specifying one of the pseudo-
       language parameters C or POSIX.  This is like deleting a formerly given
       _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e information.  The _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s in the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e are usual-
       ly in English.

       Of course, the _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e name is determined by mmaann.  In GNU mmaann,  it  is
       specified in the POSIX 1003.1 based format:

       _<_l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e_>[___<_t_e_r_r_i_t_o_r_y_>[.._<_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_-_s_e_t_>[,,_<_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_>]]],

       but  the two-letter code in _<_l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e_> is sufficient for most purposes.
       If for a complicated  _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e  formulation  no  _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s  are  found
       ggrrooffffeerr searches the country part consisting of these first two charac-
       ters as well.

       The actual directory set is copied thrice.  The _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e  name  is  ap-
       pended as subdirectory to each directory in the first copy of the actu-
       al directory set (this is only done when a language information is giv-
       en).   Then  the 2-letter abbreviation of the _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e name is appended
       as subdirectories to the second copy of the directory set (this is only
       done  when the given language name has more than 2 letters).  The third
       copy of the directory set is kept unchanged (if no _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e information
       is given this is the kept directory set).  These maximally 3 copies are
       appended to get the new directory set.

       We now have a complete set of directories to work  with.   In  each  of
       these  directories,  the _m_a_n files are separated in _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s.  The name
       of a _s_e_c_t_i_o_n is represented by a single character, a  digit  between  _1
       and _9, or the character _o or _n, in this order.

       For each available _s_e_c_t_i_o_n, a subdirectory mmaann_<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_> exists contain-
       ing all _m_a_n files for this _s_e_c_t_i_o_n, where _<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_> is a single charac-
       ter  as described before.  Each _m_a_n file in a _s_e_c_t_i_o_n directory has the
       form mmaann_<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_>//_<_n_a_m_e_>.._<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_>_[_<_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_>_]_[.._<_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_>_],  where
       _<_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_>  and _<_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_> are optional.  _<_n_a_m_e_> is the name of the
       _m_a_n _p_a_g_e that is also specified as filespec  argument  on  the  command
       line.

       The  _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is an addition to the section.  This postfix acts like a
       subsection.  An _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n occurs only in the file name, not in name  of
       the _s_e_c_t_i_o_n subdirectory.  It can be specified on the command line.

       On  the  other  hand, the _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is just an information on how the
       file is compressed.  This is not important for the user, such  that  it
       cannot be specified on the command line.

       There are 4 methods to specify a _s_e_c_t_i_o_n on the command line:

       * Environment variable _M_A_N_S_E_C_T

       * Command line option ----sseeccttiioonnss

       * Appendix to the _n_a_m_e argument in the form _<_n_a_m_e_>_._<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_>

       * Preargument before the _n_a_m_e argument in the form _<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_> _<_n_a_m_e_>

       It is also possible to specify several _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s by appending the single
       characters separated by colons.  One can imagine that this means to re-
       strict  the  _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e search to only some _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s.  The multiple _s_e_c_-
       _t_i_o_n_s are only possible for _M_A_N_S_E_C_T and ----sseeccttiioonnss.

       If no _s_e_c_t_i_o_n is specified all _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s are searched one after the oth-
       er  in  the given order, starting with _s_e_c_t_i_o_n _1, until a suitable file
       is found.

       There are 4 methods to specify an _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n on the command  line.   But
       it is not necessary to provide the whole extension name, some abbrevia-
       tion is good enough in most cases.

       * Environment variable _E_X_T_E_N_S_I_O_N

       * Command line option ----eexxtteennssiioonn

       * Appendix to the _<_n_a_m_e_>_._<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_> argument in  the  form  _<_n_a_m_e_>_._<_s_e_c_-
         _t_i_o_n_>_<_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_>

       * Preargument before the _n_a_m_e argument in the form _<_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_>_<_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_>

              The directory //uussrr//mmaann is now part of the _m_a_n _p_a_t_h;  then  there

       The program has a decompression facility.  If standard input or a  file
       that  was retrieved from the command line parameters is compressed with
       a format that is supported by either ggzziipp(1) or bbzziipp22(1) it  is  decom-
       pressed  on-the-fly.   This  includes the GNU ..ggzz, ..bbzz22, and the tradi-
       tional ..ZZ compression.  The program displays the concatenation  of  all
       decompressed  input  in  the sequence that was specified on the command
       line.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       The ggrrooffffeerr program supports many system variables,  most  of  them  by
       courtesy  of other programs.  All environment variables of ggrrooffff(1) and
       GNU mmaann(1) and some standard system variables are honored.

       _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T
              Store options for a run of ggrrooffffeerr.  The  options  specified  in
              this variable are overridden by the options given on the command
              line.  The content of this variable is  run  through  the  shell
              builtin  "eval",  so  arguments containing whitespace or special
              shell characters should be quoted.  Do not forget to export this
              variable, otherwise it does not exist during the run of ggrrooffffeerr.

   SSyysstteemm VVaarriiaabblleess
       The following variables have a special meaning for ggrrooffffeerr.

       _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y
              If set, this variable indicates that the X Window System is run-
              ning.  Testing this variable decides  on  whether  graphical  or
              text  output  is generated.  This variable should not be changed
              by the user carelessly, but it can be used to start the  graphi-
              cal  ggrrooffffeerr on a remote X Window System terminal.  For example,
              depending on your system, ggrrooffffeerr can be started on  the  second
              monitor by the command

              _s_h_# DISPLAY=:0.1 groffer what.ever &

       _L_C___A_L_L
       _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S
       _L_A_N_G   If  one  of  these variables is set (in the above sequence), its
              content is interpreted as the locale, the language to  be  used,
              especially  when  retrieving  _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.  A locale name is typi-
              cally  of  the  form  _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e[___t_e_r_r_i_t_o_r_y[.._c_o_d_e_s_e_t[@@_m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r]]],
              where  _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e is an ISO 639 language code, _t_e_r_r_i_t_o_r_y is an ISO
              3166 country code, and _c_o_d_e_s_e_t is a character  set  or  encoding
              identifier  like ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8; see sseettllooccaallee(3).  The lo-
              cale values C and POSIX stand for the default, i.e. the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e
              directories  without a language prefix.  This is the same behav-
              ior as when all 3 variables are unset.

       _P_A_G_E_R  This variable can be used to set the pager for the  tty  output.
              For  example,  to disable the use of a pager completely set this
              variable to the ccaatt(1) program

              _s_h_# PAGER=cat groffer anything


       _P_A_T_H   All programs within the ggrrooffffeerr  script  are  called  without  a
              fixed  path.   Thus this environment variable determines the set
              of programs used within the run of ggrrooffffeerr.

   GGrrooffff VVaarriiaabblleess
       The ggrrooffffeerr program internally calls ggrrooffff, so  all  environment  vari-
       ables  documented  in  ggrrooffff(1)  are  internally used within ggrrooffffeerr as
       well.  The following variable has a direct meaning for the ggrrooffffeerr pro-
       gram.

       _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_P_D_I_R
              If  the  value  of this variable is an existing, writable direc-
              tory, ggrrooffffeerr uses it for storing its temporary files,  just  as
              ggrrooffff  does.   See the ggrrooffff(1) man page for more details on the
              location of temporary files.

   MMaann VVaarriiaabblleess
       Parts of the functionality of  the  mmaann  program  were  implemented  in
       ggrrooffffeerr; support for all environment variables documented in mmaann(1) was
       added to ggrrooffffeerr, but the meaning was slightly modified due to the dif-
       ferent  approach  in  ggrrooffffeerr; but the user interface is the same.  The
       mmaann environment variables can be overwritten by options  provided  with
       _M_A_N_O_P_T, which in turn is overwritten by the command line.

       _E_X_T_E_N_S_I_O_N
              Restrict  the  search  for _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s to files having this exten-
              sion.  This is overridden by option ----eexxtteennssiioonn; see  there  for
              details.

       _M_A_N_O_P_T This  variable  contains options as a preset for mmaann(1).  As not
              all of these are relevant for ggrrooffffeerr only the  essential  parts
              of its value are extracted.  The options specified in this vari-
              able overwrite the values of  the  other  environment  variables
              that  are  specific to _m_a_n.  All options specified in this vari-
              able are overridden by the options given on the command line.

       _M_A_N_P_A_T_H
              If set, this variable contains  the  directories  in  which  the
              _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e  trees  are  stored.   This  is  overridden  by option
              ----mmaannppaatthh.

       _M_A_N_S_E_C_T
              If this is a colon separated list of section names,  the  search
              for  _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s  is  restricted to those manual sections in that
              order.  This is overridden by option ----sseeccttiioonnss.

       _S_Y_S_T_E_M If this is set to a comma separated  list  of  names  these  are
              interpreted  as  _m_a_n _p_a_g_e trees for different operating systems.
              This variable can be overwritten by option ----ssyysstteemmss; see  there
              for details.

       The  environment  variable _M_A_N_R_O_F_F_S_E_Q is ignored by ggrrooffffeerr because the
       necessary preprocessors are determined automatically.

       The ggrrooffffeerr program can be preconfigured by two configuration files.

       //eettcc//ggrrooffff//ggrrooffffeerr..ccoonnff
              System-wide configuration file for ggrrooffffeerr.

       $$HHOOMMEE//..ggrrooffff//ggrrooffffeerr..ccoonnff
              User-specific  configuration  file  for  ggrrooffffeerr,  where   _$_H_O_M_E
              denotes  the  user's  home directory.  This file is called after
              the system-wide configuration file to enable overriding  by  the
              user.

       Both  files  are  handled  for the configuration, but the configuration
       file in //eettcc comes first; it is overwritten by the  configuration  file
       in  the home directory; both configuration files are overwritten by the
       environment variable _G_R_O_F_F_E_R___O_P_T; everything is overwritten by the com-
       mand line arguments.

       The  configuration  files  contain  options  that  should  be called as
       default for every ggrrooffffeerr run.  These options are written in lines such
       that  each  contains  either  a long option, a short option, or a short
       option cluster; each with or without an argument.  So  each  line  with
       configuration  information  starts  with  a minus character "--"; a line
       with a long option starts with two minus characters "----", a line with a
       short option or short option cluster starts with a single minus "--".

       The  option  names  in  the configuration files may not be abbreviated,
       they must be exact.

       The argument for a long option can be separated from  the  option  name
       either by an equal sign "==" or by whitespace, i.e. one or several space
       or tab characters.  An argument for a  short  option  or  short  option
       cluster  can  be  directly  appended to the option name or separated by
       whitespace.  The end of an argument is the end of the line.  It is  not
       allowed  to use a shell environment variable in an option name or argu-
       ment.

       It is not necessary to use quotes in an option or argument, except  for
       empty arguments.  An empty argument can be provided by appending a pair
       of quotes to the separating equal sign  or  whitespace;  with  a  short
       option, the separator can be omitted as well.  For a long option with a
       separating equal sign "==", the pair of quotes can be omitted, thus end-
       ing  the  line with the separating equal sign.  All other quote charac-
       ters are cancelled internally.

       In the configuration files, arbitrary  whitespace  is  allowed  at  the
       beginning  of  each line, it is just ignored.  Each whitespace within a
       line is replaced by a single space character " " internally.

       All lines of the configuration lines that do not  start  with  a  minus
       character  are ignored, such that comments starting with "##" are possi-
       ble.  So there are no shell commands in the configuration files.

       As an example, consider the following configuration file  that  can  be
       used either in //eettcc//ggrrooffff//ggrrooffffeerr..ccoonnff or ~~//..ggrrooffff//ggrrooffffeerr..ccoonnff ..

       # groffer configuration file
       #
       # groffer options that are used in each call of groffer
       --foreground=DarkBlue
       --resolution=100
       --viewer=gxditview -geometry 900x1200

       The  lines  starting  with  ##  are just ignored, so they act as command
       lines.  This configuration sets four ggrrooffffeerr options (the lines  start-
       ing with "--").  This has the following effects:

       * Use  a  text color of DDaarrkkBBlluuee in all viewers that support this, such
         as ggxxddiittvviieeww.

       * Use a resolution of 110000ddppii in all viewers that support this, such  as
         ggxxddiittvviieeww.  By this, the default device in _x _m_o_d_e is set to XX110000.

       * Force ggxxddiittvviieeww(1) as the _x_-_m_o_d_e viewer using the geometry option for
         setting the width to 990000ppxx and the height to 11220000ppxx.   This  geometry
         is suitable for a resolution of 110000ddppii.

       * Use xxppddff(1) as the _p_d_f_-_m_o_d_e viewer with the argument --ZZ 115500.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The  usage  of ggrrooffffeerr is very easy.  Usually, it is just called with a
       file name or _m_a_n _p_a_g_e.  The  following  examples,  however,  show  that
       ggrrooffffeerr has much more fancy capabilities.

       _s_h_# groffer /usr/local/share/doc/groff/meintro.ms.gz

       Decompress, format and display the compressed file mmeeiinnttrroo..mmss..ggzz in the
       directory  //uussrr//llooccaall//sshhaarree//ddoocc//ggrrooffff,  using   the   standard   viewer
       ggxxddiittvviieeww  as  graphical  viewer  when  in  the X Window System, or the
       lleessss(1) pager program otherwise.

       _s_h_# groffer groff

       If the file ..//ggrrooffff exists use it as input.   Otherwise  interpret  the
       argument  as a search for the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e named ggrrooffff in the smallest pos-
       sible _m_a_n _s_e_c_t_i_o_n, being section 1 in this case.

       _s_h_# groffer man:groff

       search for the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e of ggrrooffff even when the file ..//ggrrooffff exists.

       _s_h_# groffer groff.7
       _s_h_# groffer 7 groff

       search the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e of ggrrooffff in _m_a_n _s_e_c_t_i_o_n  77.   This  section  search
       works only for a digit or a single character from a small set.

       _s_h_# groffer fb.modes

       If  the  file  ..//ffbb..mmooddeess does not exist interpret this as a search for
       the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e of ffbb..mmooddeess.  As the extension _m_o_d_e_s is not a single char-
       acter  in classical section style the argument is not split to a search
       for ffbb.

       _s_h_# groffer groff 'troff(1)' man:roff

       The arguments that are not existing files are looked-up as the  follow-
       ing  _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e_s:  ggrrooffff  (automatic search, should be found in _m_a_n sec-
       tion 1), ttrrooffff (in section 1), and rrooffff (in the section with the lowest
       number, being 7 in this case).  The quotes around _'_t_r_o_f_f_(_1_)_' are neces-
       sary because the parentheses are  special  shell  characters;  escaping
       them  with a backslash character _\_( and _\_) would be possible, too.  The
       formatted files are concatenated and displayed in one piece.

       _s_h_# LANG=de groffer --man --viewer=galeon ls

       Retrieve the German _m_a_n _p_a_g_e (language _d_e) for the llss  program,  decom-
       press it, format it to _h_t_m_l or _x_h_t_m_l format (_w_w_w _m_o_d_e) and view the re-
       sult in the web browser ggaalleeoonn.  The option ----mmaann guarantees  that  the
       _m_a_n  _p_a_g_e  is retrieved, even when a local file llss exists in the actual
       directory.

       _s_h_# groffer --source 'man:roff(7)'

       Get the _m_a_n _p_a_g_e called _r_o_f_f in _m_a_n section 7, decompress it, and print
       its unformatted content, its source code.

       _s_h_# groffer --de-p --in --ap

       This is a set of abbreviated arguments, it is determined as

       _s_h_# groffer --debug-params --intermediate-output --apropos


       _s_h_# cat file.gz | groffer -Z -mfoo

       The  file  ffiillee..ggzz is sent to standard input, this is decompressed, and
       then this is transported to the _g_r_o_f_f _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _o_u_t_p_u_t _m_o_d_e  without
       post-processing  (ggrrooffff  option  --ZZ),  using  macro  package _f_o_o (ggrrooffff
       option --mm).

       _s_h_# echo '\f(CBWOW!' |
       > groffer --x --bg red --fg yellow --geometry 200x100 -

       Display the word WWOOWW!! in a small window in  constant-width  bold  font,
       using color yellow on red background.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
       The ggrrooffffeerr program is written in Perl, the Perl version during writing
       was v5.8.8.

       ggrrooffffeerr provides its own parser for command-line arguments that is com-
       patible  to  both  POSIX  ggeettooppttss(1)  and GNU ggeettoopptt(1).  It can handle
       option arguments and file names containing white space and a large  set
       of  special  characters.   The  following standard types of options are
       supported.

       * The option consisting of a single minus -- refers to standard input.

       * A single minus followed by characters refers to  a  single  character
         option  or  a  combination  thereof;  for  example, the ggrrooffffeerr short
         option combination --QQmmffoooo is equivalent to --QQ --mm ffoooo.

       * Long options are options with names longer than one  character;  they
         are always preceded by a double minus.  An option argument can either
         go to the next command-line argument or be  appended  with  an  equal
         sign  to  the  argument;  for  example,  ----lloonngg==aarrgg  is equivalent to
         ----lloonngg aarrgg.

       * An argument of ---- ends option parsing; all further command-line argu-
         ments are interpreted as _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters, i.e. file names or con-
         structs for searching _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s).

       * All command-line arguments that are neither options nor option  argu-
         ments  are interpreted as _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters and stored until option
         parsing has finished.  For example, the command line

         _s_h_# groffer file1 -a -o arg file2

         is equivalent to

         _s_h_# groffer -a -o arg -- file1 file2


       The free mixing of options and  _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c  parameters  follows  the  GNU
       principle.   That does not fulfill the strange option behavior of POSIX
       that ends option processing as soon as the  first  non-option  argument
       has  been  reached.   The end of option processing can be forced by the
       option "----" anyway.
