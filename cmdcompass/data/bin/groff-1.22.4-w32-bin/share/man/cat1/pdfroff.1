DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ppddffrrooffff is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing system, ggrrooffff.
       It transparently handles the mechanics of multiple pass ggrrooffff  process-
       ing,  when  applied to suitably marked up ggrrooffff source files, such that
       tables of contents and body text are formatted separately, and are sub-
       sequently  combined  in  the  correct order, for final publication as a
       single PDF document.  A further optional "style  sheet"  capability  is
       provided;  this  allows for the definition of content which is required
       to precede the table of contents, in the published document.

       For each invocation of ppddffrrooffff, the ultimate  ggrrooffff  output  stream  is
       post-processed  by  the  GhostScript interpreter, to produce a finished
       PDF document.

       ppddffrrooffff makes no assumptions about, and imposes no restrictions on, the
       use of any ggrrooffff macro packages which the user may choose to employ, in
       order to achieve a desired document format; however,  it  _d_o_e_s  include
       specific  built  in  support  for the ppddffmmaarrkk macro package, should the
       user choose to employ it.  Specifically, if the _p_d_f_h_r_e_f macro,  defined
       in  the _p_d_f_m_a_r_k_._t_m_a_c package, is used to define public reference marks,
       or dynamic links to such reference marks, then ppddffrrooffff performs as many
       preformatting  ggrrooffff passes as required, up to a maximum limit of _f_o_u_r,
       in order to compile a document reference dictionary, to resolve  refer-
       ences, and to expand the dynamically defined content of links.

UUSSAAGGEE
       The  command  line is parsed in accordance with normal GNU conventions,
       but with one exception -- when specifying any short form option  (i.e.,
       a  single  character option introduced by a single hyphen), and if that
       option expects an argument, then it  _m_u_s_t  be  specified  independently
       (i.e.,  it  may  _n_o_t be appended to any group of other single character
       short form options).

       Long form option names (i.e., those introduced by a double hyphen)  may
       be abbreviated to their minimum length unambiguous initial substring.

       Otherwise, ppddffrrooffff usage closely mirrors that of ggrrooffff itself.  Indeed,
       with the exception of the --hh, --vv, and --TT _d_e_v short  form  options,  and
       all  long  form  options,  which  are parsed internally by ppddffrrooffff, all
       options and file name arguments  specified  on  the  command  line  are
       passed  on  to  ggrrooffff,  to  control the formatting of the PDF document.
       Consequently, ppddffrrooffff accepts all options and arguments,  as  specified
       in  ggrrooffff(1),  which may also be considered as the definitive reference
       for all standard ppddffrrooffff options and argument usage.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ppddffrrooffff accepts all of the short form options (i.e.,  those  introduced
       by  a  single  hyphen), which are available with ggrrooffff itself.  In most
       cases, these are simply passed transparently to ggrrooffff;  the  following,
       however, are handled specially by ppddffrrooffff.

       --hh     Same as ----hheellpp; see below.

       --ii     Process  standard  input, after all other specified input files.
              This is passed transparently to  ggrrooffff,  but,  if  grouped  with
              other  options,  it  _m_u_s_t  be the first in the group.  Hiding it
              within a group breaks standard input processing, in the multiple
              pass ggrrooffff processing context of ppddffrrooffff.

       --TT _d_e_v Only  --TT ppss  is supported by ppddffrrooffff.  Attempting to specify any
              other device causes ppddffrrooffff to abort.

       --vv     Same as ----vveerrssiioonn; see below.

       See ggrrooffff(1) for a description of all other short form  options,  which
       are transparently passed through ppddffrrooffff to ggrrooffff.

       All  long  form options (i.e., those introduced by a double hyphen) are
       interpreted locally by ppddffrrooffff; they are nnoott passed on to ggrrooffff, unless
       otherwise stated below.

       ----hheellpp Causes ppddffrrooffff to display a summary of the its usage syntax, and
              supported options, and then exit.

       ----eemmiitt--ppss
              Suppresses the final output conversion step, causing ppddffrrooffff  to
              emit  PostScript  output instead of PDF.  This may be useful, to
              capture intermediate PostScript output, when using a specialised
              postprocessor,  such  as  _g_p_r_e_s_e_n_t  for example, in place of the
              default _G_h_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t PDF writer.

       ----kkeeeepp--tteemmppoorraarryy--ffiilleess
              Suppresses the  deletion  of  temporary  files,  which  normally
              occurs after ppddffrrooffff has completed PDF document formatting; this
              may be useful, when debugging formatting problems.

              See section "Files" below for a  description  of  the  temporary
              files used by ppddffrrooffff.

       ----nnoo--ppddff--oouuttppuutt
              May   be   used   with  the  ----rreeffeerreennccee--ddiiccttiioonnaarryy==_n_a_m_e  option
              (described below) to eliminate the overhead of  PDF  formatting,
              when  running  ppddffrrooffff to create a reference dictionary, for use
              in a different document.

       ----nnoo--rreeffeerreennccee--ddiiccttiioonnaarryy
              May be used to eliminate the overhead of  creating  a  reference
              dictionary,  when  it is known that the target PDF document con-
              tains no public references, created by the _p_d_f_h_r_e_f macro.

       ----nnoo--ttoocc--rreellooccaattiioonn
              May be used to eliminate the extra ggrrooffff processing pass,  which
              is  required to generate a table of contents, and relocate it to
              the start of the PDF  document,  when  processing  any  document
              which lacks an automatically generated table of contents.

       ----nnoo--kkiillll--nnuullll--ppaaggeess
              While  preparing  for  simulation  of the manual collation step,
              which is traditionally required to relocate a _t_a_b_l_e _o_f  _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_s
              to  the  start  of  a  document, ppddffrrooffff accumulates a number of
              empty page descriptions into the intermediate _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t  output
              stream.   During the final collation step, these empty pages are
              normally discarded  from  the  finished  document;  this  option
              forces ppddffrrooffff to leave them in place.

       ----ppddff--oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Specifies the name to be used for the resultant PDF document; if
              unspecified, the PDF output is written to  standard  output.   A
              future  version  of  ppddffrrooffff  may use this option, to encode the
              document name in a generated reference dictionary.

       ----rreeffeerreennccee--ddiiccttiioonnaarryy==_n_a_m_e
              Specifies the name to be used for the generated  reference  dic-
              tionary  file;  if unspecified, the reference dictionary is cre-
              ated in a temporary file, which is  deleted  when  ppddffrrooffff  com-
              pletes  processing of the current document.  This option _m_u_s_t be
              specified, if it is desired to save  the  reference  dictionary,
              for use in references placed in other PDF documents.

       ----rreeppoorrtt--pprrooggrreessss
              Causes  ppddffrrooffff  to display an informational message on standard
              error, at the start of each ggrrooffff processing pass.

       ----ssttyylleesshheeeett==_n_a_m_e
              Specifies the name of an _i_n_p_u_t _f_i_l_e, to be used as a style sheet
              for  formatting of content, which is to be placed _b_e_f_o_r_e the ta-
              ble of contents, in the formatted PDF document.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Causes ppddffrrooffff to display a version identification message.  The
              entire  command line is then passed transparently to ggrrooffff, in a
              _o_n_e pass operation _o_n_l_y, in  order  to  display  the  associated
              ggrrooffff version information, before exiting.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       The following environment variables may be set, and exported, to modify
       the behaviour of ppddffrrooffff.

       _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E
              Specifies the program to be used for collation of  the  finished
              PDF document.

              This  collation  step may be required to move _t_a_b_l_e_s _o_f _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_s
              to the start of the finished PDF document, when formatting  with
              traditional  macro  packages, which print them at the end.  How-
              ever, users should not normally need to specify _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E,
              (and  indeed,  are  not  encouraged  to do so).  If unspecified,
              ppddffrrooffff uses sseedd(1) by default, which normally suffices.

              If _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E _i_s specified, then it must act as  a  filter,
              accepting a list of file name arguments, and write its output to
              the   _s_t_d_o_u_t   stream,   whence   it    is    piped    to    the
              _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___P_O_S_T_P_R_O_C_E_S_S_O_R___C_O_M_M_A_N_D,  to produce the finished PDF out-
              put.

              When specifying _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E, it  is  normally  necessary  to
              also specify _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___K_I_L_L___N_U_L_L___P_A_G_E_S.

              _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E  is  ignored,  if  ppddffrrooffff  is  invoked with the
              _-_-_n_o_-_k_i_l_l_-_n_u_l_l_-_p_a_g_e_s option.

       _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___K_I_L_L___N_U_L_L___P_A_G_E_S
              Specifies options to be passed to the _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E program.

              It   should   not   normally    be    necessary    to    specify
              _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___K_I_L_L___N_U_L_L___P_A_G_E_S.   The  internal  default  is  a  sseedd(1)
              script, which is intended to remove completely blank pages  from
              the  collated  output stream, and which should be appropriate in
              most applications of ppddffrrooffff.  However, if  any  alternative  to
              sseedd(1)  is specified for _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E, then it is likely that
              a     corresponding      alternative      specification      for
              _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___K_I_L_L___N_U_L_L___P_A_G_E_S is required.

              As  in  the  case of _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___C_O_L_L_A_T_E, _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___K_I_L_L___N_U_L_L___P_A_G_E_S is
              ignored, if ppddffrrooffff is  invoked  with  the  _-_-_n_o_-_k_i_l_l_-_n_u_l_l_-_p_a_g_e_s
              option.

       _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___P_O_S_T_P_R_O_C_E_S_S_O_R___C_O_M_M_A_N_D
              Specifies  the command to be used for the final document conver-
              sion from PostScript intermediate output to PDF.  It must behave
              as  a  filter, writing its output to the _s_t_d_o_u_t stream, and must
              accept an arbitrary number of _f_i_l_e_s _._._. arguments, with the spe-
              cial case of _- representing the _s_t_d_i_n stream.

              If unspecified, _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___P_O_S_T_P_R_O_C_E_S_S_O_R___C_O_M_M_A_N_D defaults to

       _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_P_D_I_R
              Identifies  the  directory in which ppddffrrooffff should create tempo-
              rary files.  If _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_P_D_I_R is _n_o_t specified,  then  the  vari-
              ables  _T_M_P_D_I_R,  _T_M_P and _T_E_M_P are considered in turn, as possible
              temporary file repositories.  If none of  these  are  set,  then

              Specifies the program to be invoked, when ppddffrrooffff converts ggrrooffff
              PostScript output to PDF.  If  _P_D_F_R_O_F_F___P_O_S_T_P_R_O_C_E_S_S_O_R___C_O_M_M_A_N_D  is
              specified,  then  the  command  name  it specifies is _i_m_p_l_i_c_i_t_l_y
              assigned  to   _G_R_O_F_F___G_H_O_S_T_S_C_R_I_P_T___I_N_T_E_R_P_R_E_T_E_R,   overriding   any
              explicit    setting    specified   in   the   environment.    If
              _G_R_O_F_F___G_H_O_S_T_S_C_R_I_P_T___I_N_T_E_R_P_R_E_T_E_R is  not  specified,  then  ppddffrrooffff
              searches the process _P_A_T_H, looking for a program with any of the
              well known names for the GhostScript interpreter; if  no  Ghost-
              Script interpreter can be found, ppddffrrooffff aborts.

       _G_R_O_F_F___A_W_K___I_N_T_E_R_P_R_E_T_E_R
              Specifies  the program to be invoked, when ppddffrrooffff is extracting
              reference dictionary entries from a ggrrooffff  intermediate  message
              stream.  If _G_R_O_F_F___A_W_K___I_N_T_E_R_P_R_E_T_E_R is not specified, then ppddffrrooffff
              searches the process _P_A_T_H, looking for any of the preferred pro-
              grams, `gawk', `mawk', `nawk', and `awk', in this order; if none
              of these are found, ppddffrrooffff issues a warning message,  and  con-
              tinue processing; however, in this case, no reference dictionary
              is created.

       _O_S_T_Y_P_E Typically defined automatically by the operating system,  _O_S_T_Y_P_E
              is  used  on Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS platforms _o_n_l_y, to infer the
              default _P_A_T_H___S_E_P_A_R_A_T_O_R character, which is used when parsing the
              process _P_A_T_H to search for external helper programs.

       _P_A_T_H___S_E_P_A_R_A_T_O_R
              If  set,  _P_A_T_H___S_E_P_A_R_A_T_O_R overrides the default separator charac-
              ter, (`:' on POSIX/Unix systems, inferred from _O_S_T_Y_P_E on  Micro-
              soft  Win32/MS-DOS), which is used when parsing the process _P_A_T_H
              to search for external helper programs.

       _S_H_O_W___P_R_O_G_R_E_S_S
              If this is set to a non-empty value, then ppddffrrooffff always behaves
              as  if the ----rreeppoorrtt--pprrooggrreessss option is specified, on the command
              line.

FFIILLEESS
       Input and output files for ppddffrrooffff may be named according to  any  con-
       vention  of  the  user's  choice.   Typically, input files may be named
       according to the choice of  the  principal  formatting  macro  package,
       e.g., file_._m_s might be an input file for formatting using the mmss macros
       (_s_._t_m_a_c); normally, the final output file should be named file_._p_d_f.

       Temporary files, created by ppddffrrooffff, are  placed  in  the  file  system
       hierarchy, in or below the directory specified by environment variables
       (see section "Environment" above).  If mmkktteemmpp(1) is  available,  it  is
       invoked  to  create  a  private subdirectory of the nominated temporary
       files directory, (with subdirectory  name  derived  from  the  template
       _p_d_f_r_o_f_f_-_X_X_X_X_X_X_X_X_X_X);  if this subdirectory is successfully created, the
       temporary files will be placed within it, otherwise they will be placed
       directly in the directory nominated in the environment.

       All  temporary  files  themselves are named according to the convention
       _p_d_f$$_.*, where _$_$ is  the  standard  shell  variable  representing  the
       process  ID  of the ppddffrrooffff process itself, and _* represents any of the
       extensions used by ppddffrrooffff to  identify  the  following  temporary  and
       intermediate files.

       _p_d_f$$_._t_m_p
              A  scratch  pad  file, used to capture reference data emitted by
              ggrrooffff, during the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y compilation phase.

       _p_d_f$$_._r_e_f
              The _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y, as compiled in the last but  one  pass
              of  the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y compilation phase; (at the start of
              the first pass,  this  file  is  created  empty;  in  successive
              passes,  it  contains  the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y entries, as col-
              lected in the preceding pass).

              If the ----rreeffeerreennccee--ddiiccttiioonnaarryy=_n_a_m_e  option  is  specified,  this
              intermediate  file  becomes permanent, and is named _n_a_m_e, rather
              than _p_d_f$$_._r_e_f.

       _p_d_f$$_._c_m_p
              Used to collect _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y entries during  the  active
              pass  of the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y compilation phase.  At the end
              of any pass, when the content of _p_d_f$$_._c_m_p compares as identical
              to   _p_d_f$$_._r_e_f,   (or   the  corresponding  file  named  by  the
              ----rreeffeerreennccee--ddiiccttiioonnaarryy=_n_a_m_e option), then  _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y
              compilation  is  terminated,  and  the _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _m_a_p is
              appended to this intermediate file, for inclusion in  the  final
              formatting passes.

       _p_d_f$$_._t_c
              An  intermediate  _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t  file, in which "Table of Contents"
              entries are collected, to facilitate relocation before the  body
              text, on ultimate output to the _G_h_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t postprocessor.

       _p_d_f$$_._p_s
              An  intermediate _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t file, in which the body text is col-
              lected prior to ultimate output to the  _G_h_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t  postproces-
              sor, in the proper sequence, _a_f_t_e_r _p_d_f$$_._t_c.

       See  ggrrooffff(1)  for the definitive reference to document formatting with
       ggrrooffff.  Since ppddffrrooffff provides a superset of  all  ggrrooffff  capabilities,
       ggrrooffff(1)  may  also be considered to be the definitive reference to all

       While  ppddffrrooffff  imposes neither any restriction on, nor any requirement
       for, the use of any specific ggrrooffff macro package, a number of  supplied
       macro  packages,  and  in  particular those associated with the package
       _p_d_f_m_a_r_k_._t_m_a_c, are best suited for use with  ppddffrrooffff  as  the  preferred
