       hhppffttooddiitt   creates   a   font  file  for  use  with  a  Hewlett-Packard
       LaserJet 4-series (or newer) printer with ggrrooffff --TTlljj44, using data  from
       an  HP  tagged font metric (TFM) file.  _t_f_m_-_f_i_l_e is the name of the TFM
       file for the font; Intellifont and TrueType TFM  files  are  supported,
       but  symbol set TFM files are not.  _m_a_p_-_f_i_l_e is a file giving the _g_r_o_f_f
       names for characters in  the  font;  this  file  should  consist  of  a
       sequence of lines of the form:
              _m _u _c_1 _c_2 ... [# _c_o_m_m_e_n_t]
       where _m is a decimal integer giving the MSL (Master Symbol List) number
       of the character, _u is a hexadecimal integer giving the  Unicode  value
       of the character, and _c_1, _c_2, ...  are the _g_r_o_f_f names of the character
       (see ggrrooffff__cchhaarr(7) for a list).  The values can  be  separated  by  any
       whitespace;  the  Unicode value must use uppercase digits A-F, and must
       be without a leading `00xx', `uu', or `UU++'.  Unicode values  corresponding
       to composite glyphs are decomposed; e.g., `uu0000CC00' becomes `uu00004411__00330000'.
       The name for a glyph without a _g_r_o_f_f name may be given as uu_X_X_X_X if  the
       glyph corresponds to a Unicode value, or as an unnamed glyph `------'.  If
       the given Unicode value is in the Private Use Area (0xE000-0xF8FF), the
       glyph  is  included  as  an  unnamed glyph.  Refer to ggrrooffff__ddiiffff(1) for
       additional information about unnamed glyphs and how to access them.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with `##' are ignored.  A `##'  following
       one or more _g_r_o_f_f names begins a comment.  Because `##' is a valid _g_r_o_f_f
       name, it must appear first in a list of _g_r_o_f_f names  if  a  comment  is
       included, e.g.,
              33   00002233   ##   ## nnuummbbeerr ssiiggnn
       or
              33   00002233   ## sshh   ## nnuummbbeerr ssiiggnn
       rather than
              33   00002233   sshh ##   ## nnuummbbeerr ssiiggnn
       which will treat the first `##' as the beginning of the comment.

       The  _g_r_o_f_f  font  file is written to the specified _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_o_n_t; if this
       operand is `--', the font file is written to the standard output.

       The --ss option should be given if the font is special (a font  is  "spe-
       cial"  if  _g_r_o_f_f  should search it whenever a character is not found in
       the current font).  If the font is special, it should be listed in  the
       ffoonnttss  command in the DESC file; if it is not special, there is no need
       to list it, since _g_r_o_f_f can automatically  mount  it  when  it's  first
       used.

       If  the  --ii  option  is  used,  hhppffttooddiitt automatically will generate an
       italic correction, a left italic correction and a subscript  correction
       for  each  character (the significance of these parameters is explained
       in ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5)).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     Include characters in the TFM file that are not included in _m_a_p_-
              _f_i_l_e.   A  glyph  with  corresponding Unicode value is given the
              name u_X_X_X_X; a glyph without a Unicode value is  included  as  an
              unnamed  glyph  `---'.  A glyph with a Unicode value in the Pri-
              vate Use Area (0xE000-0xF8FF) also is  included  as  an  unnamed
              glyph.

              This  option provides a simple means of adding Unicode-named and
              unnamed glyphs to a font without including them in the map file,
              but  it affords little control over which glyphs are placed in a
              regular font and which are placed in a special font.  The  pres-
              ence or absence of the --ss option has some effect on which glyphs
              are included: without the --ss option, only the "text" symbol sets
              are  searched  for matching glyphs; with the --ss option, only the
              "mathematical" symbol sets are searched.  Nonetheless, restrict-
              ing  the  symbol sets searched isn't very selective--many glyphs
              are placed in both regular and special fonts.  Normally, the  --aa
              option should be used only as a last resort.

       --dd     Dump information about the TFM file to the standard output; this
              option can be useful for ensuring that a TFM file  is  a  proper
              match  for  a  font,  and  that the contents of the TFM file are
              suitable.  The information includes the values of important  TFM
              tags,  and a listing (by MSL number for Intellifont TFM files or
              by Unicode value for TrueType TFM files) of the glyphs  included
              in  the  TFM file.  The unit of measure `DU' for some tags indi-
              cates design units; there are  8782  design  units  per  em  for
              Intellifont  fonts,  and  2048  design units per em for TrueType
              fonts.  Note that the accessibility of a glyph  depends  on  its
              inclusion  in  a symbol set; some TFM files list many glyphs but
              only a few symbol sets.

              The glyph listing includes the glyph index within the TFM  file,
              the  MSL or Unicode value, and the symbol set and character code
              that will be used to print the glyph.   If  _m_a_p_-_f_i_l_e  is  given,
              _g_r_o_f_f  names  are  given for matching glyphs.  If only the glyph
              index and MSL or Unicode value are given,  the  glyph  does  not
              appear in any supported symbol set and cannot be printed.

              With  the  --dd  option,  _m_a_p_-_f_i_l_e is optional, and _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_o_n_t is
              ignored if given.

       --qq     Suppress warnings about characters in the map file that were not
              found  in  the  TFM  file.  Warnings never are given for unnamed
              glyphs or by glyphs named by their Unicode values.  This  option
              is  useful  when  sending the output of hhppffttooddiitt to the standard
              output.

       --vv     Print the hhppffttooddiitt version number and exit.

       --ss     The font is special.  This option adds the  ssppeecciiaall  command  to
              the font file, and affects the order in which HP symbol sets are
              searched for each glyph.  Without the --ss option, the "text" sets
              are searched before the "mathematical" symbol sets.  With the --ss
              option, the search order is reversed.

       --ii_n    Generate an italic correction for each  character  so  that  the
              character's  width  plus  the  character's  italic correction is
              equal to _n thousandths of an em plus the  amount  by  which  the
              right  edge  of  the character's bounding is to the right of the
              character's origin.  If this would result in a  negative  italic
              correction, use a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x-height
              of  the  font.   If  this would result in a subscript correction
              greater than the italic correction, use a  subscript  correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also  generate a left italic correction for each character equal
              to _n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left edge
              of  the  character's  bounding box is to the left of the charac-
              ter's origin.  The left italic correction may be negative.

              This option normally is  needed  only  with  italic  or  oblique
              fonts; a value of 50 (0.05 em) usually is a reasonable choice.
