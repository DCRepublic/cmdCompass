DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggrrooddvvii is a driver for ggrrooffff that produces TeX DVI format.  Normally it
       should be run by ggrrooffff --TTddvvii.  This will run ttrrooffff --TTddvvii; it will  also
       input the macros in _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_t_m_a_c_/_d_v_i_._t_m_a_c.

       The  DVI file generated by ggrrooddvvii can be printed by any correctly-writ-
       ten DVI driver.  The troff drawing primitives are implemented using the
       tpic  version 2 specials.  If the driver does not support these, the \\DD
       commands will not produce any output.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       \\DD''RR _d_h _d_v''
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at the cur-
              rent position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the current
              position +(_d_h,_d_v).  Afterwards the current position will  be  at
              the  opposite  corner.  This produces a rule in the DVI file and
              so can be printed even with a driver that does not  support  the
              tpic specials unlike the other \\DD commands.

       The  groff  command \\XX''_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g'' is translated into the same command in
       the DVI file as would be produced by \\ssppeecciiaall{{_a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g}}  in  TeX;  _a_n_y_-
       _t_h_i_n_g may not contain a newline.

       For inclusion of EPS image files, --TTddvvii loads _p_s_p_i_c_._t_m_a_c automatically,
       providing the PPSSPPIICC macro.  Please check ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5) for  a  detailed
       description.

       Font  files for ggrrooddvvii can be created from tfm files using ttffmmttooddiitt(1).
       The font description file should contain the following additional  com-
       mands:

       iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee _n_a_m_e
              The name of the tfm file (without the _._t_f_m extension) is _n_a_m_e.

       cchheecckkssuumm _n
              The checksum in the tfm file is _n.

       ddeessiiggnnssiizzee _n
              The designsize in the tfm file is _n.

       These are automatically generated by ttffmmttooddiitt..

       The default color for \\mm and \\MM is black.  Currently, the drawing color
       for \\DD commands is always black, and fill color values  are  translated
       to gray.

       In  ttrrooffff  the  \\NN  escape sequence can be used to access characters by
       their position in the corresponding tfm file; all characters in the tfm
       file can be accessed this way.

       By design, the DVI format doesn't care about physical dimensions of the
       output medium.  Instead, ggrrooddvvii emits the  equivalent  to  TeX's  \\ssppee--
       cciiaall{{ppaappeerrssiizzee==_w_i_d_t_h,,_l_e_n_g_t_h}}  on  the  first  page; ddvviippss (and possibly
       other DVI drivers) then sets the page size accordingly.  If either  the
       page width or length is not positive, no papersize special is output.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --dd     Do  not  use tpic specials to implement drawing commands.  Hori-
              zontal and vertical lines will be implemented by  rules.   Other
              drawing commands will be ignored.

       --FF_d_i_r  Prepend  directory  dir_/_d_e_vname  to the search path for font and
              device description files; _n_a_m_e is the name of the  device,  usu-
              ally ddvvii.

       --ll     Specify landscape orientation.

       --pp_p_a_p_e_r_s_i_z_e
              Specify  paper dimensions.  This overrides the ppaappeerrssiizzee, ppaappeerr--
              lleennggtthh, and ppaappeerrwwiiddtthh commands in the _D_E_S_C file; it accepts the
              same  arguments  as the ppaappeerrssiizzee command (see ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for
              details).

       --vv     Print the version number.

       --ww_n    Set the default line thickness to _n thousandths of  an  em.   If
              this  option  isn't  specified,  the  line thickness defaults to
              0.04 em.

UUSSAAGGEE
       There are styles called RR, II, BB, and BBII mounted  at  font  positions  1
       to 4.   The  fonts  are grouped into families TT and HH having members in
       each of these styles:

              TTRR     CM Roman (cmr10)
              TTII     CM Text Italic (cmti10)
              TTBB     CM Bold Extended Roman (cmbx10)
              TTBBII    CM Bold Extended Text Italic (cmbxti10)
              HHRR     CM Sans Serif (cmss10)
              HHII     CM Slanted Sans Serif (cmssi10)
              HHBB     CM Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbx10)
              HHBBII    CM Slanted Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbxo10)

       There are also the following fonts which are not members of a family:

              CCWW     CM Typewriter Text (cmtt10)
              CCWWII    CM Italic Typewriter Text (cmitt10)

       Special fonts are MMII (cmmi10), SS (cmsy10), EEXX  (cmex10),  SSCC  (cmtex10,
       only  for  CCWW),  and,  perhaps surprisingly, TTRR, TTII, and CCWW, due to the
       different font encodings of text fonts.  For italic fonts, CCWWII is  used
       instead of CCWW.

       Finally,  the  symbol  fonts  of  the American Mathematical Society are
       available as special fonts SSAA (msam10)  and  SSBB  (msbm10).   These  two
       fonts are not mounted by default.

       Using  the  option  --mmeecc (which loads the file _e_c_._t_m_a_c) provides the EC
       and TC fonts.  The design of the EC family is very similar to  that  of
       the  CM  fonts; additionally, they give a much better coverage of groff
       symbols.  Note that _e_c_._t_m_a_c must be called before any language-specific
       files; it doesn't take care of hcode values.

BBUUGGSS
       Dvi  files  produced  by ggrrooddvvii use a different resolution (57816 units
       per inch) from those produced  by  TeX.   Incorrectly  written  drivers
       which  assume the resolution used by TeX, rather than using the resolu-
       tion specified in the DVI file will not work with ggrrooddvvii.

       When using the --dd option with boxed  tables,  vertical  and  horizontal
       lines  can  sometimes  protrude by one pixel.  This is a consequence of
       the way TeX requires that the heights and widths of rules be rounded.
