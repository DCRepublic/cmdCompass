DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       iinnddxxbbiibb makes an inverted index  for  the  bibliographic  databases  in
       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e...   for  use  with  rreeffeerr(1),  llooookkbbiibb(1), and llkkbbiibb(1).  The
       index will be named filename_._i; the index is  written  to  a  temporary
       file  which  is then renamed to this.  If no filenames are given on the
       command line because the --ff option has been used, and no --oo  option  is
       given, the index will be named _I_n_d_._i.

       Bibliographic  databases  are  divided  into  records  by  blank lines.
       Within a record, each fields starts with a %% character at the beginning
       of  a  line.  Fields have a one letter name which follows the %% charac-
       ter.

       The values set by the --cc, --nn, --ll, and --tt  options  are  stored  in  the
       index; when the index is searched, keys will be discarded and truncated
       in a manner appropriate to these options; the  original  keys  will  be
       used  for verifying that any record found using the index actually con-
       tains the keys.  This means that a user  of  an  index  need  not  know
       whether  these options were used in the creation of the index, provided
       that not all the keys to be searched for would have been discarded dur-
       ing  indexing  and that the user supplies at least the part of each key
       that would have remained after being truncated  during  indexing.   The
       value set by the --ii option is also stored in the index and will be used
       in verifying records found using the index.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --vv     Print the version number.

       --ww     Index whole files.  Each file is a separate record.

       --cc_f_i_l_e Read the list of common words from _f_i_l_e instead of _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/
              _g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_e_i_g_n.

       --dd_d_i_r  Use  _d_i_r  as  the  pathname  of the current working directory to
              store in the index, instead of the path printed by ppwwdd(1).  Usu-
              ally  _d_i_r  will  be a symbolic link that points to the directory
              printed by ppwwdd(1).

       --ff_f_i_l_e Read the files to be indexed from _f_i_l_e.  If  _f_i_l_e  is  --,  files
              will  be  read  from  the  standard input.  The --ff option can be
              given at most once.

       --ii_s_t_r_i_n_g
              Don't index the contents of fields whose names  are  in  _s_t_r_i_n_g.
              Initially _s_t_r_i_n_g is XXYYZZ.

       --hh_n    Use  the  first prime greater than or equal to _n for the size of
              the hash table.  Larger values of _n will usually make  searching
              faster, but will make the index larger and iinnddxxbbiibb use more mem-
              ory.  Initially _n is 997.

       --kk_n    Use at most _n keys per input record.  Initially _n is 100.

       --ll_n    Discard keys that are shorter than _n.  Initially _n is 3.

       --nn_n    Discard the _n most common words.  Initially _n is 100.

       --oo_b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e
              The index should be named basename_._i.

       --tt_n    Truncate keys to _n.  Initially _n is 6.

FFIILLEESS
       filename_._i
              Index.

       _I_n_d_._i  Default index name.

       _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_e_i_g_n
              List of common words.

       _i_n_d_x_b_i_bXXXXXX
              Temporary file.
