       The  name  _d_i_t_r_o_f_f  refers  to  a  historical  development stage of the
       _r_o_f_f(7) text processing system.  In _r_o_f_f systems extant today, the name
       _t_r_o_f_f is a synonym for _d_i_t_r_o_f_f.

       Early  versions  of _r_o_f_f by Joe Ossanna generated two programs from the
       same sources, using conditional compilation to distinguish them.  _n_r_o_f_f
       produced text-oriented TTY output, while _t_r_o_f_f generated graphical out-
       put for exactly one output device, the Wang Graphic Systems CAT  photo-
       typesetter.

       In  1979, Brian Kernighan rewrote _t_r_o_f_f to support more devices by cre-
       ating an intermediate output format for _t_r_o_f_f that could  be  fed  into
       postprocessor  programs  which  actually do the printout on the device.
       Kernighan's version marks what is known as "classical troff" today.  In
       order  to distinguish it from Ossanna's original version, it was called
       _d_i_t_r_o_f_f (_device _independent _troff) on some systems, though this  naming
       isn't mentioned in the classical documentation.

       Today,  all existing _r_o_f_f systems are based on Kernighan's multi-device
       _t_r_o_f_f.  The distinction between _t_r_o_f_f and _d_i_t_r_o_f_f is no  longer  neces-
       sary; each modern _t_r_o_f_f provides the complete functionality of _d_i_t_r_o_f_f.

       The  easiest way to use _d_i_t_r_o_f_f is via the GNU _r_o_f_f system, _g_r_o_f_f.  The
       _g_r_o_f_f(1) program is a wrapper around _(_d_i_)_t_r_o_f_f that automatically  han-
       dles device postprocessing.

              (_d_i_t_r_o_f_f).

       _r_o_f_f(7)
              provides a history and conceptual overview of _r_o_f_f systems.

       _t_r_o_f_f(1)
              describes the GNU implementation of _(_d_i_)_t_r_o_f_f.

       _g_r_o_f_f(1)
              documents  the GNU _r_o_f_f program and includes pointers to further
              documentation about _g_r_o_f_f.

       _g_r_o_f_f___o_u_t(5)
              describes the _g_r_o_f_f version of the intermediate output language,
              the basis for multi-device output.
