<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
reads two or more PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM images as input. It
performs the specified binary arithmetic operation on their
sample values and produces an output of a format which is
the more general of the two input formats. The two input
images must be of the same width and height. The arithmetic
is performed on each pair of identically located tuples to
generate the identically located tuple of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For functions
that are commutative and associative, <b>pamarith</b>
applies <br>
the binary function repetitively on as many input images as
you supply. For <br>
example, for <b>-add</b> , the output is the sum of all the
inputs. For <br>
other functions (e.g. <b>-subtract</b>), the program fails
if you supply <br>
more than two input images. (Before Netpbm 10.93 (December
2020), the <br>
program always failed with more than two input images).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For some other
functions, <b>pamarith</b> could theoretically compute a
<br>
meaningful result for multiple arguments, but it fails
nonetheless if you <br>
give more than two input images. <b>-mean</b> and
<b>-equal</b> are in that <br>
category.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of what
<b>pamarith</b> does is not meaningful for visual images. It
<br>
works toward Netpbm&rsquo;s secondary purpose of just
manipulating arbitrary <br>
matrices of numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of the calculation, it assumes any PBM, PGM, or PPM input
image is the equivalent PAM image of tuple type
<b>BLACKANDWHITE</b>, <b>GRAYSCALE</b>, or <b>RGB</b>,
respectively, and if it produces a PBM, PGM, or PPM output,
produces the equivalent of the PAM image which is the result
of the calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
<i>pamfile</i> argument identifies the &quot;left&quot;
argument image; the second <i>pamfile</i> argument
identifies the &quot;right&quot; one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the output
is PAM, the tuple type is the same as the tuple type of the
left input image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
performs the arithmetic on each pair of identically located
tuples in the two input images.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The arithmetic
operation is in all cases fundamentally a function from two
integers to an integer (but see below - the functions are
defined in ways that you can effectively e.g. add real
numbers). The operation is performed on two tuples as
follows. The two input images must have the same depth, or
one of them must have depth one. <b>pamarith</b> fails if
one of these is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If they have
the same depth, <b>pamarith</b> simply carries out the
arithmetic one sample at a time. I.e. if at a particular
position the left input image contains the tuple
(s1,s2,...,sN) and the right input image contains the tuple
(t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the output image
contains the tuple (f(s1,t1),f(s2,t2),...,f(sN,tN)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If one of the
images has depth 1, the arithmetic is performed between the
one sample in that image and each of the samples in the
other. I.e. if at a particular position the left input image
contains the tuple (s) and the right input image contains
the tuple (t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the
output image contains the tuple
(f(s,t1),f(s,t2),...,f(s,tN)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PBM
Oddness</b> <br>
If you&rsquo;re familiar with the PBM format, you may find
<b>pamarith</b>&rsquo;s operation on PBM images to be
nonintuitive. Because in PBM black is represented as 1 and
white as 0, you might be expecting black minus black to be
white.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But the PBM
format is irrelevant, because <b>pamarith</b> operates on
the numbers found in the PAM equivalent (see above). In a
PAM black and white image, black is 0 and white is 1. So
black minus black is black.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Maxval</b>
<br>
The meanings of the samples with respect to the maxval
varies according to the function you select.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In PAM images
in general, the most usual meaning of a sample (the one that
applies when a PAM image represents a visual image), is that
it represents a fraction of some maximum. The maxval of the
image corresponds to some maximum value (in the case of a
visual image, it corresponds to &quot;full
intensity.&quot;), and a sample value divided by the maxval
gives the fraction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>pamarith</b>, this interpretation applies to the regular
arithmetic functions: <b>-add</b>, <b>-subtract</b>,
<b>-multiply</b>, <b>-divide</b>, <b>-difference</b>,
<b>-minimum</b>, <b>-maximum</b>, <b>-mean</b>,
<b>-equal</b>, and <b>-compare</b>. For those, you should
think of the arguments and result as numbers in the range
[0,1). For example, if the maxval of the left argument image
is 100 and the maxval of the right argument image is 200 and
the maxval of the output image is 200, and the left sample
value in an <b>-add</b> calculation is 50 and the right
sample is 60, the actual calculation is 50/100 + 60/200 =
160/200, and the output sample value is 160.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For these
functions, <b>pamarith</b> makes the output image&rsquo;s
maxval the maximum of the two input maxvals, except with
<b>-equal</b> and <b>-compare</b>. For <b>-equal</b>, the
output maxval is always 1. For <b>-compare</b>, it is always
2. (Before Netpbm 10.14 (February 2003), there was no
exception for <b>-compare</b>; in 10.14, the exception was
just that the maxval was <i>at least</i> 2, and sometime
between 10.18 and 10.26 (January 2005), it changed to being
exactly 2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the result
of a calculation falls outside the range [0, 1),
<b>pamarith</b> clips it -- i.e. considers it to be zero or
1-.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In many cases,
where both your input maxvals are the same, you can just
think of the operation as taking place between the sample
values directly, with no consideration of the maxval except
for the clipping. E.g. an <b>-add</b> of sample value 5 to
sample value 8 yields sample value 13.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But with
<b>-multiply</b>, this doesn&rsquo;t work. Say your two
input images have maxval 255, which means the output image
also has maxval 255. Consider a location in the image where
the input sample values are 5 and 10. You might think the
multiplicative product of those would yield 50 in the
output. But <b>pamarith</b> carries out the arithmetic on
the fractions 5/255 and 10/255. It multiplies those together
and then rescales to the output maxval, giving a sample
value in the output PAM of 50/255 rounded to the nearest
integer: 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the bit
string operations, the maxval has a whole different meaning.
The operations in question are: <b>-and</b>, <b>-or</b>,
<b>-nand</b>, <b>-nor</b>, <b>-xor</b>, and
<b>-shiftleft</b>, <b>-shiftright</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With these,
each sample value in one or both input images, and in the
output image, represents a bit string, not a number. The
maxval tells how wide the bit string is. The maxval must be
a full binary count (a power of two minus one, such as 0xff)
and the number of ones in it is the width of the bit string.
For the dyadic bit string operations (that&rsquo;s
everything but the shift functions), the maxvals of the
input images must be the same and <b>pamarith</b> makes the
maxval of the output image the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the bit
shift operations, the output maxval is the same as the left
input maxval. The right input image (which contains the
shift counts) can have any maxval and the maxval is
irrelevant to the interpretation of the samples. The sample
value is the actual shift count. But it&rsquo;s still
required that no sample value exceed the maxval.</p>

<h2>NOTE: UNARY FUNCTIONS
<a name="NOTE: UNARY FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
applies only binary functions. If you want to apply a unary
function, e.g. &quot;halve&quot;, to a single image, use
<b>pamfunc</b>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably <b>-quiet</b>, see
<a href="index.html#commonoptions"> Common Options</a> ),
<b>pamarith</b> recognizes the following command line
options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Function</b> <br>
These options select the function that <b>pamarith</b>
applies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Calculates the absolute value
of the difference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-multiply</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Does an ordinary arithmetic
multiplication, but tends to produce nonobvious results
because of the way <b>pamarith</b> interprets sample values.
See <a href="#maxval">Maxval</a> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-divide</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Divides a value in the left
input image by the value in the right input image. But like
<b>-multiply</b>, it tends to produce nonobvious results.
Note that <b>pamarith</b> clipping behavior makes this of
little use when the left argument (dividend) is greater than
the right argument (divisor) -- the result in that case is
always the maxval. If the divisor is 0, the result is the
maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-divide</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

maxval is always 1 for <b>-equal</b>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the maxvals
of the input images are not identical, <b>pamarith</b> may
claim two values are not equal when in fact they are,
because of the precision with which it does the arithmetic.
However, it will never say A is greater than B if A is less
than B.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You can make
the equality test approximate with the <b>-closeness</b>
option. This gives the percentage of maxval by which the
samples can differ and still be considered equal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-equal</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.93 (December 2020).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-compare</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produces the value <b>0</b>
when the value in the left input image is less than the
value in the right input image, <b>1</b> when the values are
equal, and <b>2</b> when the left is greater than the
right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the maxvals
of the input images are not identical, <b>pamarith</b> may
claim two values are not equal when in fact they are,
because of the precision with which it does the arithmetic.
However, it will never say A is greater than B if A is less
than B.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-compare</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-and</b>, <b>-nand</b>,
<b>-or</b>, <b>-nor</b>, <b>-xor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These consider the input and
output images to contain bit strings; they compute bitwise
logic operations. Note that if the maxval is 1, you can also
look at these as logic operations on boolean input values.
See section <a href="#maxval">Maxval</a> for the special
meaning of maxval with respect to bit string operations such
as these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-shiftleft</b>,
<b>-shiftright</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These consider the left input
image and output image to contain bit strings. They compute
a bit shift operation, with bits falling off the left or
right end and zeroes shifting in, as opposed to bits off one
end to the other. The right input image sample value is the
number of bit positions to shift.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
maxval (see <a href="#maxval">Maxval</a> ) determines the
width of the frame within which you are shifting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other <br>
-closeness</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This changes the meaning of
<b>-equal</b>. It is not valid with any other function. See
the description of <b>-equal</b>.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamarith</b>
replaced <b>pnmarith</b> in Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm 10.3
through 10.8, though, <b>pamarith</b> was not backward
compatible because it required the input images to be of the
same depth, so you could not multiply a PBM by a PPM as is
often done for masking. (It was not intended at the time
that <b>pnmarith</b> would be removed from Netpbm -- the
plan was just to rewrite it to use <b>pamarith</b>; it was
removed by mistake).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But starting
with Netpbm 10.9 (September 2002), <b>pamarith</b> allows
the images to have different depths as long as one of them
has depth 1, and that made it backward compatible with
<b>pnmarith</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
<b>pnmarith</b> did not have the <b>-mean</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-compare</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.13 (December
2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The bit string
operations were added in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-divide</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.30 (October
2005).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ability to
have more than one input (operand) was added in Netpbm 10.93
(December 2020).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-equal</b> option was added in Netpbm 10.93 (December
2020).</p>
