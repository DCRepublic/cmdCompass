<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ppmshadow - add
simulated shadows to a PPM image</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
[<b>-b</b> <i>blur_size</i>] [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t</b>]
[<b>-x</b> <i>xoffset</i>] [<b>-y</b> <i>yoffset</i>]
[<i>ppmfile</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
adds a simulated shadow to an image, giving the appearance
that the contents of the image float above the page, casting
a diffuse shadow on the background. Shadows can either be
black, as cast by opaque objects, or translucent, where the
shadow takes on the color of the object which casts it. You
can specify the crispness of the shadow and its displacement
from the image with command line options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
sees your image as a foreground on a background. The
background color is whatever color the top left pixel of
your image is. The background is all the pixels that are
that color and the foreground is everything else. The shadow
that <b>ppmshadow</b> generates is a shadow of the
foreground, cast on the background.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The shadow is
the same size as the foreground, plus some fringes as
determined by the <b>-b</b> option. It is truncated to fit
in your image. The output image is the same dimensions as
the input image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
<b>pamcomp</b> to place a foreground image over a background
before running <b>ppmshadow</b> on it. You can use
<b>ppmmake</b> to make the background image (just an image
of a solid color).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output has
the same dimensions and maxval as the input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The blurring to
make the fringes of the shadow will not have a desirable
effect if the color depth (maxval) of the image is too low
-- you need a high maxval to get all the shades needed to
create a smooth gradient. So if your input has low maxval
(including most notably if the input is PBM, which means its
maxval is 1), run it through <b>pamdepth</b> to raise its
maxval. 255 is usually a good choice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Input is a PPM
file named by the <i>ppmfile</i> command line argument; if
you don&rsquo;t specify <i>ppmfile</i>, the input is
Standard Input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output is a
PPM file, written to Standard Output.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
recognizes the following command line options: <b><br>
-b</b> <i>blur_size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the distance of the light
source from the image. Larger values move the light source
closer, casting a more diffuse shadow, while smaller
settings move the light further away, yielding a sharper
shadow. <i>blur_size</i> is the number of pixels of fringe
there is on the shadow, beyond where the shadow would be if
there were no blurring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
11 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option controls only the fringing effect of moving the light
source closer to the object. It does not make the shadow
grow or shrink as would happpen in the real world if you
moved a point light source closer to and further from an
object.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-k</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Keep the intermediate temporary image files. When
debugging, these intermediate files provide many clues as to
the source of an error. See <a href="#tempfiles">below</a>
for a list of the contents of each file.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-t</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Consider the non-background material in the image
translucent -- it casts shadows of its own color rather than
a black shadow, which is default. This often results in
fuzzy, difficult-to-read images but in some circumstances
may look better.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-x</b> <i>xoffset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the displacement of
the light source to the left of the image. Larger settings
of <b>xoffset</b> displace the shadow to the right, as would
be cast by a light further to the left. If not specified,
the horizontal offset is half of <i>blur_size</i> (above),
to the left.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-y</b> <i>yoffset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the displacement of
the light source above the top of the image. Larger settings
displace the shadow downward, corresponding to moving the
light further above the top of the image. If you don&rsquo;t
specify <b>-y</b>, the vertical offset defaults to the same
as the horizontal offset (above), upward.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
does not recognize the options common to all programs based
on libnetpbm (See <a href="index.html#commonoptions"> Common
Options</a> .) However, the <b>-version</b> option
works.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The source
image must contain sufficient space on the edges in the
direction in which the shadow is cast to contain the shadow
-- if it doesn&rsquo;t some of the internal steps may fail.
You can usually expand the border of a too-tightly-cropped
image with <b>pnmmargin</b> before processing it with
<b>ppmshadow</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Black pixels
and pixels with the same color as the image background
don&rsquo;t cast a shadow. If this causes unintentional
&quot;holes&quot; in the shadow, fill the offending areas
with a color which differs from black or the background by
RGB values of 1, which will be imperceptible to the viewer.
Since the comparison is exact, the modified areas will now
cast shadows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The background
color of the source image (which is preserved in the output)
is deemed to be the color of the pixel at the top left of
the input image. If that pixel isn&rsquo;t part of the
background, simply add a one-pixel border at the top of the
image, generate the shadow image, then delete the border
from it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If something
goes wrong along the way, the error messages from the
various Netpbm programs <b>ppmshadow</b> calls will, in
general, provide little or no clue as to where
<b>ppmshadow</b> went astray. In this case, Specify the
<b>-k</b> option and examine the intermediate results in the
temporary files (which this option causes to be preserved).
If you manually run the commands that <b>ppmshadow</b> runs
on these files, you can figure out where the problem is. In
problem cases where you want to manually tweak the image
generation process along the way, you can keep the
intermediate files with the <b>-k</b> option, modify them
appropriately with an image editor, then recombine them with
the steps used by the code in <b>ppmshadow</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Shadows are by
default black, as cast by opaque material in the image
occluding white light. Use the <b>-t</b> option to simulate
translucent material, where the shadow takes on the color of
the object that casts it. If the contrast between the image
and background is insufficient, the <b>-t</b> option may
yield unattractive results which resemble simple blurring of
the original image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because Netpbm
used to have a maximum maxval of 255, which meant that the
largest convolution kernel <b>pnmconvol</b> could use was 11
by 11, <b>ppmshadow</b> includes a horrid, CPU-time-burning
kludge which, if a blur of greater than 11 is requested,
performs an initial convolution with an 11 x 11 kernel, then
calls <b>pnmsmooth</b> (which is itself a program that calls
<b>pnmconvol</b> with a 3 x 3 kernel) as many times as the
requested blur exceeds 11. It&rsquo;s ugly, but it gets the
job done on those rare occasions where you need a blur
greater than 11.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you wish to
generate an image at high resolution, then scale it to
publication size with <b>pamscale</b> in order to eliminate
jagged edges by resampling, it&rsquo;s best to generate the
shadow in the original high resolution image, prior to
scaling it down in size. If you scale first and then add the
shadow, you&rsquo;ll get an unsightly jagged stripe between
the edge of material and its shadow, due to resampled pixels
intermediate between the image and background obscuring the
shadow.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
returns status 0 if processing was completed without errors,
and a nonzero Unix error code if an error prevented
generation of output. Some errors may result in the script
aborting, usually displaying error messages from various
Netpbm components it uses, without returning a nonzero error
code. When this happens, the output file will be empty, so
be sure to test this if you need to know if the program
succeeded.</p>

<h2>TEMPORARY FILES
<a name="TEMPORARY FILES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ppmshadow</b>
creates a number of temporary files as it executes. It
creates a new directory for them in the directory named by
the <b>TMPDIR</b> environment variable, defaulting to
<b>/tmp</b> if it is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In normal
operation, <b>ppmshadow</b> finds a unique name for the
temporary directory and deletes each temporary file as soon
as it is done with it and leaves no debris around after it
completes. To preserve the intermediate files for debugging,
use the <b>-k</b> command line option. In that case, the
directory name is <b>ppmshadow</b><i>pid</i>, where
<i>pid</i> is the process ID of the <b>ppmshadow</b>
process, and the program fails if <b>ppmshadow</b> cannot
create that directory because the name is already in
use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The temporary
files are: <b><br>
infile.ppm</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A copy of the input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>background.ppm</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Blank image with background of
source image</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bgmask.ppm</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>blurredlackshad.ppm</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Blurred shadow image before
