<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a GIF file as
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program
creates only individual GIF images. To combine multiple GIF
images into an animated GIF, use
<a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/"><b>gifsicle</b></a>
(not part of the Netpbm package).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
creates either an original GIF87 format GIF file or the <br>
newer GIF89 format. It creates GIF89 when the output needs
to have features <br>
that were new with GIF89, to wit transparency or comments.
Otherwise, it <br>
creates GIF87. Really old GIF readers conceivably could not
recognize <br>
GIF89. The output needs to have transparency when either the
input has a <br>
transparency information or you specify the
<b>-transparent</b> option. It <br>
needs to have comments when you specify the <b><br>
-comment</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
generates a GIF image with a single image block, which means
the image cannot have more than 256 colors in it (it
contains a single color map with a maximum size of 256). If
the image you want to convert has more colors than that
(<b>ppmhist</b> can tell you), you can use <b>pnmquant</b>
to reduce it to 256. Or use the more complex but faster
method described under the <b>-mapfile</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your input
image is a PAM with transparency information,
<b>pamtogif</b> uses one entry in the GIF colormap
specifically for the transparent pixels, so you can have at
most 255 opaque colors. In contrast, if you use the
<b>-transparent</b> option, one of the colors from the input
becomes transparent, so the limit is still 256.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
recognizes transparency information in the input by the <br>
tuple type being <b>RGB_ALPHA</b>, <b>GRAYSCALE_ALPHA</b>,
or <b><br>
BLACKANDWHITE_ALPHA</b>. This is the case for any image that
has <br>
transparency information and was created by a Netpbm program
that <br>
manipulates visual images. If, on the other hand, you have a
PAM generated <br>
some other way, but you know the planes have the same
meaning as implied by <br>
these tuple types, you can make <b>pamtogif</b> process the
transparency <br>
information by changing the tuple type accordingly before
you pass it <br>
to <b>pamtogif</b>. You can use <b>pamstack</b> to change
the tuple type.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). In older Netpbm,
use <b>ppmtogif</b>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably <b>-quiet</b>, see
<a href="index.html#commonoptions"> Common Options</a> ),
<b>pamtogif</b> recognizes the following command line
options: <b><br>
-interlace</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Produce an interlaced GIF
file.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>-sort</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Produce a GIF file with a color map sorted in a
predictable order.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This does
<i>not</i> produce the sorted color map which is part of the
GIF format. That kind of sorted color map is one where the
colors are sorted according to how important they are, and
the GIF header tells the viewer that it is sorted that way.
Its purpose is to allow the viewer to use fewer colors than
are in the color map if it is not capable of displaying all
the colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">What this
option produces is a color map sorted by red value, then
green, then blue. That can be useful in analyzing GIF
images, particularly those made with two versions of the
program, because it removes some of the variability.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-mapfile=</b><i>mapfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Use the colors
found in the file <i>mapfile</i> to create the colormap in
the GIF file, instead of the colors from <i>netpbmfile</i>.
<i>mapfile</i> can be any PPM file; all that matters is the
colors in it. If the colors in <i>netpbmfile</i> do not
match those in <i>mapfile</i>, <b>pamtogif</b> matches them
to a &quot;best match.&quot; You can obtain a much better
result by using <b>pnmremap</b> to change the colors in the
input to those in the map file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>mapfile</i> file is not a palette file, just an image
whose colors you want to use. The order of colors in the GIF
palette have nothing to do with where they appear in the
<i>mapfile</i> image, and duplication of colors in the image
is irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The map
file&rsquo;s depth must match the number of color components
in the input (which is not necessarily the same as the
input&rsquo;s depth -- the input might have a transparency
plane in addition). If your map file does not, or it
<i>might</i> not, run your input through <b>pnmremap</b>
using the same map file so that it does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
<b>-mapfile</b> to speed up conversion of an image where you
already have a map file because of earlier processing of
your image. For example, it is common to start with an image
that has more than 256 colors and remap its colors to a set
of 256 colors so that <b>pamgtogif</b> can convert it (a GIF
can have only 256 colors; <b>pamtogif</b> without
<b>-mapfile</b> fails on any image that has more than that)
with <b>pnmquant</b>. When you do this, <b>pnmquant</b>
generates a palette to do the color quantization, then
<b>pamtogif</b> generates an identical palette from the
quantized image. You can save computation by generating the
palette once:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">$ pnmcolormap
256 myimage.ppm &gt;/tmp/colormap.ppm <br>
$ pamtogif myimage.ppm -mapfile=/tmp/colormap.ppm
&gt;output.gif</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-transparent=</b><i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>pamtogif</b> marks the
specified color as transparent in the GIF image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t specify <b>-transparent</b>, <b>pamtogif</b>
does not mark any color transparent (except as indicated by
the transparency information in the input file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Specify the
color (<i>color</i>) as described for the
<a href="libnetpbm_image.html#colorname">argument of the
<b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine</a> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the color
you specify is not present in the image, <b>pamtogif</b>
selects instead the color in the image that is closest to
the one you specify. Closeness is measured as a Cartesian
distance between colors in RGB space. If multiple colors are
equidistant, <b>pamtogif</b> chooses one of them
arbitrarily.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
prefix your color specification with &quot;=&quot;, e.g.
<b>-transparent==red</b>, only the exact color you specify
will be transparent. If that color does not appear in the
image, there will be no transparency. <b>pamtogif</b> issues
an information message when this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When you
specify <b>-transparent</b>, <b>pamtogif</b> ignores
explicit transparency information (the &quot;alpha
channel&quot;) in the input image.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-alphacolor=</b><i>color</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This specifies the foreground
color for transparent pixels. A viewer may use the
foreground color for a transparent pixel if it chooses not
to have another color &quot;show through.&quot;. The default
is black.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This applies
only to pixels that are transparent in the GIF because they
are transparent in the Netpbm input. If a GIF pixel is
transparent because of the <b>-transparent</b> option, the
foreground color is the color indicated by that option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
GIF, all transparent pixels have the same foreground color.
(There is only one entry in the GIF colormap for transparent
pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Specify the
color (<i>color</i>) as described for the
<a href="libnetpbm_image.html#colorname">argument of the
<b>pnm_parsecolor()</b> library routine</a> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-comment=</b><i>text</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Include a comment in the GIF
output with comment text <i>text</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, there are no comments in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in a
command shell, you&rsquo;ll have to use quotation marks
around <i>text</i> if it contains characters (e.g. space)
that would make the shell think it is multiple arguments:
<br>
$ pamtogif -comment &quot;this is a comment&quot;
&lt;xxx.ppm &gt;xxx.gif</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-noclear</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
causes the output not to contain any GIF clear codes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In GIF, the
stream defines codes that represent strings of pixels as it
goes. The stream contains definitions of codes mixed in with
the references to those codes that describe the pixels of
the image. GIF specifies a maximum number of codes that can
be defined; when the stream has defined that many, the
stream can either just use those for the rest of the image
or include a clear code, deleting all the string codes so
that the stream can start over defining new ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By far the most
common choice is the clear code. This usually results in a
smaller stream because the set of strings of pixels that
occur in an image vary over the parts of the image. Hardly
any GIF encoders produce streams that don&rsquo;t use the
clear code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">But it is
conceivable that a stream could be smaller without the use
of the clear code because it saves the stream having to
redefine the same string codes over and over. It could even
avoid a thrashing situation where the stream continually
defines a set of strings that never get used again before
the maximum is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
to use the clear codes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.82 (March 2018). Before that, the program
aways uses the clear codes.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
causes the GIF output, and thus <b>pamtogif</b>, not to use
LZW (Lempel-Ziv) compression. As a result, the image file is
larger and, before the patent expired, no royalties would be
owed to the holder of the patent on LZW. See the section
LICENSE below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">LZW is a method
for combining the information from multiple pixels into a
single GIF code. With the <b>-nolzw</b> option,
<b>pamtogif</b> creates one GIF code per pixel, so it is not
doing any compression and not using LZW. However, any GIF
decoder, whether it uses an LZW decompressor or not, will
correctly decode this uncompressed format. An LZW
decompressor would see this as a particular case of LZW
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
someone uses an LZW decompressor such as the one in
<b>giftopnm</b> or pretty much any graphics display program
to process the output of <b>pamtogif -nolzw</b> , he is then
using the LZW patent. But the patent holder expressed far
less interest in enforcing the patent on decoding than on
encoding.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-aspect=</b><i>fraction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the aspect ratio of the
pixels of the image. Its only effect is to record that
information in the GIF for use by whatever interprets the
GIF. Note that this feature of GIF is hardly ever used and
most GIF decoders ignore this information and assume pixels
are square.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Pixels in a
Netpbm image do not have aspect ratios; there is always a
one-one correspondence between GIF pixels and Netpbm
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The aspect
ratio is the quotient of width divided by height. GIF allows
aspect ratios from 0.25 (1:4) to 4 (4:1) in increments of
1/64. <b>pamtogif</b> implements a natural extension of GIF
that allows an aspect ratio up to 4 14/64. If you specify
anything outside this range, <b>pamtogif</b> fails.
<b>pamtogif</b> rounds <i>fraction</i> to the nearest
1/64.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
square (1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007). Before that, the pixels
are always square.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option causes
<b>pamtogif</b> to display information about the conversion
process and the image it produces.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtogif</b>
was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). It replaced
<b>ppmtogif</b>, which created GIF images for Pbmplus/Netpbm
users since 1989.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
outward change in the conversion from <b>ppmtogif</b> to
<b>pamtogif</b> was that <b>pamtogif</b> was able to use
transparency information (&quot;alpha channel&quot;) in PAM
input, whereas with <b>ppmtogif</b>, one had to supply the
transparency mask in a separate pseudo-PGM image (via the
<b>-alpha</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Jef Poskanzer
wrote <b>ppmtogif</b> in 1989, and it has always been a
cornerstone of Pbmplus/Netpbm because GIF is such a popular
image format. Jef based the LZW encoding on GIFENCOD by
David Rowley &lt;<i>mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu</i>&gt;. Jef
included GIFENCOD&rsquo;s GIFCOMPR.C file pretty much whole.
Rowley, in turn, adapted the LZW compression code from
classic Unix <b>compress</b>, which used techniques
described in IEEE Computer, June 1984.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Jef&rsquo;s
<b>ppmtogif</b> notably lacked the ability to use a
transparency mask with it. You could create transparent
pixels in a GIF, but only with the <b>-transparent</b>
option, which allowed one to specify that all pixels of a
certain color in the input were to be transparent. Bryan
Henderson added the <b>-alpha</b> option in July 2001 so you
could supply a mask image that indicates exactly which
pixels are to be transparent, and those pixels could have
the same color as other opaque ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bryan Henderson
added another significant piece of code and function in
October 2001: the ability to generate a GIF without using
the LZW patent -- an uncompressed GIF. This was very
important to many people at the time because the GIF patent
was still in force, and this allowed them to make an image
that any GIF viewer could display, royalty-free. Bryan
adapted code from the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s
<b>djpeg</b> for that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
code in <b>pamtogif</b> from Jef&rsquo;s original, but Jef
may still hold copyright over it because of the way in which
it evolved. Virtually all of the code in <b>pamtogif</b> was
written by Bryan Henderson and contributed to the public
domain.</p>

<h2>LICENSE
<a name="LICENSE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
<b>pamtogif</b> without the <b>-nolzw</b> option, you are
using a patent on the LZW compression method which is owned
by Unisys. The patent has expired (in 2003 in the US and in
2004 elsewhere), so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. While the
patent was in force, most people who used <b>pamtogif</b>
and similar programs did so without a license from Unisys to
do so. Unisys typically asked $5000 for a license for
trivial use of the patent. Unisys never enforced the patent
against trivial users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rumor has it
that IBM also owns or owned a patent covering
<b>pamtogif</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A replacement
for the GIF format that never required any patents to use is
the PNG format.</p>
