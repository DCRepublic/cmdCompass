<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
is used to take a base backup of a running PostgreSQL
database cluster. The backup is taken without affecting
other clients of the database, and can be used both for
point-in-time recovery (see Section&nbsp;26.3) and as the
starting point for a log-shipping or streaming-replication
standby server (see Section&nbsp;27.2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
makes an exact copy of the database cluster's files, while
making sure the server is put into and out of backup mode
automatically. Backups are always taken of the entire
database cluster; it is not possible to back up individual
databases or database objects. For selective backups,
another tool such as <b>pg_dump</b>(1) must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The backup is
made over a regular PostgreSQL connection that uses the
replication protocol. The connection must be made with a
user ID that has REPLICATION permissions (see
Section&nbsp;22.2) or is a superuser, and pg_hba.conf must
permit the replication connection. The server must also be
configured with max_wal_senders set high enough to provide
at least one walsender for the backup plus one for WAL
streaming (if used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There can be
multiple <b>pg_basebackup</b>s running at the same time, but
it is usually better from a performance point of view to
take only one backup, and copy the result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
can make a base backup from not only a primary server but
also a standby. To take a backup from a standby, set up the
standby so that it can accept replication connections (that
is, set <i>max_wal_senders</i> and hot_standby, and
configure its pg_hba.conf appropriately). You will also need
to enable full_page_writes on the primary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
are some limitations in taking a backup from a standby:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
backup history file is not created in the database cluster
backed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
pg_basebackup cannot force the standby to switch to a new
WAL file at the end of backup. When you are using -X none,
if write activity on the primary is low, pg_basebackup may
need to wait a long time for the last WAL file required for
the backup to be switched and archived. In this case, it may
be useful to run <b>pg_switch_wal</b> on the primary in
order to trigger an immediate WAL file switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If the
standby is promoted to be primary during backup, the backup
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; All WAL
records required for the backup must contain sufficient
full-page writes, which requires you to enable
<i>full_page_writes</i> on the primary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever
pg_basebackup is taking a base backup, the server's
pg_stat_progress_basebackup view will report the progress of
the backup. See Section&nbsp;28.4.5 for details.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command-line options control the location and format of the
output:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-D</b>
<i>directory</i> <b><br>
--pgdata=</b><i>directory</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the target directory to
write the output to. pg_basebackup will create this
directory (and any missing parent directories) if it does
not exist. If it already exists, it must be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the backup
is in tar format, the target directory may be specified as -
(dash), causing the tar file to be written to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-F</b>
<i>format</i> <b><br>
--format=</b><i>format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Selects the format for the
output. <i>format</i> can be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">p <br>
plain</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Write the output as plain
files, with the same layout as the source server's data
directory and tablespaces. When the cluster has no
additional tablespaces, the whole database will be placed in
the target directory. If the cluster contains additional
tablespaces, the main data directory will be placed in the
target directory, but all other tablespaces will be placed
in the same absolute path as they have on the source server.
(See <b>--tablespace-mapping</b> to change that.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
default format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">t <br>
tar</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Write the output as tar files
in the target directory. The main data directory's contents
will be written to a file named base.tar, and each other
tablespace will be written to a separate tar file named
after that tablespace's OID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If the target
directory is specified as - (dash), the tar contents will be
written to standard output, suitable for piping to (for
example) gzip. This is only allowed if the cluster has no
additional tablespaces and WAL streaming is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-R <br>
--write-recovery-conf</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Creates a standby.signal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">file and
appends connection settings to the postgresql.auto.conf file
in the target directory (or within the base archive file
when using tar format). This eases setting up a standby
server using the results of the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
postgresql.auto.conf file will record the connection
settings and, if specified, the replication slot that
pg_basebackup is using, so that streaming replication will
use the same settings later on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-t</b>
<i>target</i> <b><br>
--target=</b><i>target</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instructs the server where to
place the base backup. The default target is client, which
specifies that the backup should be sent to the machine
where pg_basebackup is running. If the target is instead set
to server:/some/path, the backup will be stored on the
machine where the server is running in the /some/path
directory. Storing a backup on the server requires superuser
privileges or having privileges of the pg_write_server_files
role. If the target is set to blackhole, the contents are
discarded and not stored anywhere. This should only be used
for testing purposes, as you will not end up with an actual
backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since WAL
streaming is implemented by pg_basebackup rather than by the
server, this option cannot be used together with -Xstream.
Since that is the default, when this option is specified,
you must also specify either -Xfetch or -Xnone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-T</b>
<i>olddir</i><b>=</b><i>newdir</i> <b><br>

--tablespace-mapping=</b><i>olddir</i><b>=</b><i>newdir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Relocates the tablespace in
directory <i>olddir</i> to <i>newdir</i> during the backup.
To be effective, <i>olddir</i> must exactly match the path
specification of the tablespace as it is defined on the
source server. (But it is not an error if there is no
tablespace in <i>olddir</i> on the source server.) Meanwhile
<i>newdir</i> is a directory in the receiving host's
filesystem. As with the main target directory, <i>newdir</i>
need not exist already, but if it does exist it must be
empty. Both <i>olddir</i> and <i>newdir</i> must be absolute
paths. If either path needs to contain an equal sign (=),
precede that with a backslash. This option can be specified
multiple times for multiple tablespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a tablespace
is relocated in this way, the symbolic links inside the main
data directory are updated to point to the new location. So
the new data directory is ready to be used for a new server
instance with all tablespaces in the updated locations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, this
option only works with plain output format; it is ignored if
tar format is selected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--waldir=</b><i>waldir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the directory to write WAL
(write-ahead log) files to. By default WAL files will be
placed in the pg_wal subdirectory of the target directory,
but this option can be used to place them elsewhere.
<i>waldir</i> must be an absolute path. As with the main
target directory, <i>waldir</i> need not exist already, but
if it does exist it must be empty. This option can only be
specified when the backup is in plain format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-X</b>
<i>method</i> <b><br>
--wal-method=</b><i>method</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Includes the required WAL
(write-ahead log) files in the backup. This will include all
write-ahead logs generated during the backup. Unless the
method none is specified, it is possible to start a
postmaster in the target directory without the need to
consult the log archive, thus making the output a completely
standalone backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
<i>method</i>s for collecting the write-ahead logs are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">n <br>
none</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Don't include write-ahead logs
in the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">f <br>
fetch</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The write-ahead log files are
collected at the end of the backup. Therefore, it is
necessary for the source server's wal_keep_size parameter to
be set high enough that the required log data is not removed
before the end of the backup. If the required log data has
been recycled before it's time to transfer it, the backup
will fail and be unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">When tar format
is used, the write-ahead log files will be included in the
base.tar file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">s <br>
stream</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Stream write-ahead log data
while the backup is being taken. This method will open a
second connection to the server and start streaming the
write-ahead log in parallel while running the backup.
Therefore, it will require two replication connections not
just one. As long as the client can keep up with the
write-ahead log data, using this method requires no extra
write-ahead logs to be saved on the source server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">When tar format
is used, the write-ahead log files will be written to a
separate file named pg_wal.tar (if the server is a version
earlier than 10, the file will be named pg_xlog.tar).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This value is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-z <br>
--gzip</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables gzip compression of tar
file output, with the default compression level. Compression
is only available when using the tar format, and the suffix
.gz will automatically be added to all tar filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-Z</b>
<i>level</i> <b><br>
-Z
[{client|server}-]</b><i>method</i><b>[:</b><i>detail</i><b>]
<br>
--compress=</b><i>level</i> <b><br>

--compress=[{client|server}-]</b><i>method</i><b>[:</b><i>detail</i><b>]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Requests compression of the
backup. If client or server is included, it specifies where
the compression is to be performed. Compressing on the
server will reduce transfer bandwidth but will increase
server CPU consumption. The default is client except when
--target is used. In that case, the backup is not being sent
to the client, so only server compression is sensible. When
-Xstream, which is the default, is used, server-side
compression will not be applied to the WAL. To compress the
WAL, use client-side compression, or specify -Xfetch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The compression
method can be set to gzip, lz4, zstd, or none for no
compression. A compression detail string can optionally be
specified. If the detail string is an integer, it specifies
the compression level. Otherwise, it should be a
comma-separated list of items, each of the form keyword or
keyword=value. Currently, the supported keywords are level
and workers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
compression level is specified, the default compression
level will be used. If only a level is specified without
mentioning an algorithm, gzip compression will be used if
the level is greater than 0, and no compression will be used
if the level is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the tar
format is used with gzip, lz4, or zstd, the suffix .gz,
.lz4, or .zst, respectively, will be automatically added to
all tar filenames. When the plain format is used,
client-side compression may not be specified, but it is
still possible to request server-side compression. If this
is done, the server will compress the backup for
transmission, and the client will decompress and extract
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When this
option is used in combination with -Xstream, pg_wal.tar will
be compressed using gzip if client-side gzip compression is
selected, but will not be compressed if any other
compression algorithm is selected, or if server-side
compression is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command-line options control the generation of the backup
and the invocation of the program:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-c
{fast|spread} <br>
--checkpoint={fast|spread}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets checkpoint mode to fast
(immediate) or spread (the default) (see
Section&nbsp;26.3.3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-C <br>
--create-slot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies that the replication
slot named by the --slot option should be created before
starting the backup. An error is raised if the slot already
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-l</b>
<i>label</i> <b><br>
--label=</b><i>label</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the label for the backup.
If none is specified, a default value of
&ldquo;pg_basebackup base backup&rdquo; will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-n <br>
--no-clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, when
<b>pg_basebackup</b> aborts with an error, it removes any
directories it might have created before discovering that it
cannot finish the job (for example, the target directory and
write-ahead log directory). This option inhibits tidying-up
and is thus useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
tablespace directories are not cleaned up either way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-N <br>
--no-sync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default,
<b>pg_basebackup</b> will wait for all files to be written
safely to disk. This option causes <b>pg_basebackup</b> to
return without waiting, which is faster, but means that a
subsequent operating system crash can leave the base backup
corrupt. Generally, this option is useful for testing but
should not be used when creating a production
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-P <br>
--progress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables progress reporting.
Turning this on will deliver an approximate progress report
during the backup. Since the database may change during the
backup, this is only an approximation and may not end at
exactly 100%. In particular, when WAL log is included in the
backup, the total amount of data cannot be estimated in
advance, and in this case the estimated target size will
increase once it passes the total estimate without WAL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-r</b>
<i>rate</i> <b><br>
--max-rate=</b><i>rate</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the maximum transfer rate
at which data is collected from the source server. This can
be useful to limit the impact of pg_basebackup on the
server. Values are in kilobytes per second. Use a suffix of
M to indicate megabytes per second. A suffix of k is also
accepted, and has no effect. Valid values are between 32
kilobytes per second and 1024 megabytes per second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
always affects transfer of the data directory. Transfer of
WAL files is only affected if the collection method is
fetch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-S</b>
<i>slotname</i> <b><br>
--slot=</b><i>slotname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option can only be used
together with -X stream. It causes WAL streaming to use the
specified replication slot. If the base backup is intended
to be used as a streaming-replication standby using a
replication slot, the standby should then use the same
replication slot name as primary_slot_name. This ensures
that the primary server does not remove any necessary WAL
data in the time between the end of the base backup and the
start of streaming replication on the new standby.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The specified
replication slot has to exist unless the option <b>-C</b> is
also used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this option
is not specified and the server supports temporary
replication slots (version 10 and later), then a temporary
replication slot is automatically used for WAL
streaming.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-v <br>
--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables verbose mode. Will
output some extra steps during startup and shutdown, as well
as show the exact file name that is currently being
processed if progress reporting is also enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--manifest-checksums=</b><i>algorithm</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the checksum
algorithm that should be applied to each file included in
the backup manifest. Currently, the available algorithms are
NONE, CRC32C, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512. The
default is CRC32C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If NONE is
selected, the backup manifest will not contain any
checksums. Otherwise, it will contain a checksum of each
file in the backup using the specified algorithm. In
addition, the manifest will always contain a SHA256 checksum
of its own contents. The SHA algorithms are significantly
more CPU-intensive than CRC32C, so selecting one of them may
increase the time required to complete the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using a SHA
hash function provides a cryptographically secure digest of
each file for users who wish to verify that the backup has
not been tampered with, while the CRC32C algorithm provides
a checksum that is much faster to calculate; it is good at
catching errors due to accidental changes but is not
resistant to malicious modifications. Note that, to be
useful against an adversary who has access to the backup,
the backup manifest would need to be stored securely
elsewhere or otherwise verified not to have been modified
since the backup was taken.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pg_verifybackup</b>(1)
can be used to check the integrity of a backup against the
backup manifest.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--manifest-force-encode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Forces all filenames in the
backup manifest to be hex-encoded. If this option is not
specified, only non-UTF8 filenames are hex-encoded. This
option is mostly intended to test that tools which read a
backup manifest file properly handle this case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-estimate-size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prevents the server from
estimating the total amount of backup data that will be
streamed, resulting in the backup_total column in the
pg_stat_progress_basebackup view always being NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, the backup will start by enumerating the size of the
entire database, and then go back and send the actual
contents. This may make the backup take slightly longer, and
in particular it will take longer before the first data is
sent. This option is useful to avoid such estimation time if
it's too long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
not allowed when using <b>--progress</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-manifest</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disables generation of a backup
manifest. If this option is not specified, the server will
generate and send a backup manifest which can be verified
using <b>pg_verifybackup</b>(1). The manifest is a list of
every file present in the backup with the exception of any
WAL files that may be included. It also stores the size,
last modification time, and an optional checksum for each
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-slot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prevents the creation of a
temporary replication slot for the backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default, if
log streaming is selected but no slot name is given with the
<b>-S</b> option, then a temporary replication slot is
created (if supported by the source server).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The main
purpose of this option is to allow taking a base backup when
the server has no free replication slots. Using a
replication slot is almost always preferred, because it
prevents needed WAL from being removed by the server during
the backup.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-verify-checksums</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disables verification of
checksums, if they are enabled on the server the base backup
is taken from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
checksums are verified and checksum failures will result in
a non-zero exit status. However, the base backup will not be
removed in such a case, as if the <b>--no-clean</b> option
had been used. Checksum verification failures will also be
reported in the pg_stat_database view.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command-line options control the connection to the source
server:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-d</b>
<i>connstr</i> <b><br>
--dbname=</b><i>connstr</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies parameters used to
connect to the server, as a connection string; these will
override any conflicting command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The option is
called --dbname for consistency with other client
applications, but because pg_basebackup doesn't connect to
any particular database in the cluster, any database name in
the connection string will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-h</b>
<i>host</i> <b><br>
--host=</b><i>host</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the host name of the
machine on which the server is running. If the value begins
with a slash, it is used as the directory for a Unix domain
socket. The default is taken from the <b>PGHOST</b>
environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket
connection is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-p</b>
<i>port</i> <b><br>
--port=</b><i>port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the TCP port or local
Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is
listening for connections. Defaults to the <b>PGPORT</b>
environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-s</b>
<i>interval</i> <b><br>
--status-interval=</b><i>interval</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the number of seconds
between status packets sent back to the source server.
Smaller values allow more accurate monitoring of backup
progress from the server. A value of zero disables periodic
status updates completely, although an update will still be
sent when requested by the server, to avoid timeout-based
disconnects. The default value is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-U</b>
<i>username</i> <b><br>
--username=</b><i>username</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the user name to
connect as.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-w <br>
--no-password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prevents issuing a password
prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a
password is not available by other means such as a .pgpass
file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be
useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to
enter a password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-W <br>
--password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Forces pg_basebackup to prompt
for a password before connecting to the source server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
never essential, since pg_basebackup will automatically
prompt for a password if the server demands password
authentication. However, pg_basebackup will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing <b>-W</b> to
avoid the extra connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other options
are also available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-V <br>
--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prints the pg_basebackup
version and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-? <br>
--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Shows help about pg_basebackup
command line arguments, and exits.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility,
like most other PostgreSQL utilities, uses the environment
variables supported by libpq (see Section&nbsp;34.15).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
variable <b>PG_COLOR</b> specifies whether to use color in
diagnostic messages. Possible values are always, auto and
never.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the
beginning of the backup, a checkpoint needs to be performed
on the source server. This can take some time (especially if
the option --checkpoint=fast is not used), during which
pg_basebackup will appear to be idle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The backup will
include all files in the data directory and tablespaces,
including the configuration files and any additional files
placed in the directory by third parties, except certain
temporary files managed by PostgreSQL. But only regular
files and directories are copied, except that symbolic links
used for tablespaces are preserved. Symbolic links pointing
to certain directories known to PostgreSQL are copied as
empty directories. Other symbolic links and special device
files are skipped. See Section&nbsp;55.4 for the precise
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In plain
format, tablespaces will be backed up to the same path they
have on the source server, unless the option
--tablespace-mapping is used. Without this option, running a
plain format base backup on the same host as the server will
not work if tablespaces are in use, because the backup would
have to be written to the same directory locations as the
original tablespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When tar format
is used, it is the user's responsibility to unpack each tar
file before starting a PostgreSQL server that uses the data.
If there are additional tablespaces, the tar files for them
need to be unpacked in the correct locations. In this case
the symbolic links for those tablespaces will be created by
the server according to the contents of the tablespace_map
file that is included in the base.tar file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
works with servers of the same or an older major version,
down to 9.1. However, WAL streaming mode (-X stream) only
works with server version 9.3 and later, and tar format
(--format=tar) only works with server version 9.5 and
later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_basebackup
will preserve group permissions for data files if group
permissions are enabled on the source cluster.</p>
