<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_verifybackup
is used to check the integrity of a database cluster backup
taken using <b>pg_basebackup</b> against a backup_manifest
generated by the server at the time of the backup. The
backup must be stored in the &quot;plain&quot; format; a
&quot;tar&quot; format backup can be checked after
extracting it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
to note that the validation which is performed by
pg_verifybackup does not and cannot include every check
which will be performed by a running server when attempting
to make use of the backup. Even if you use this tool, you
should still perform test restores and verify that the
resulting databases work as expected and that they appear to
contain the correct data. However, pg_verifybackup can
detect many problems that commonly occur due to storage
problems or user error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Backup
verification proceeds in four stages. First, pg_verifybackup
reads the backup_manifest file. If that file does not exist,
cannot be read, is malformed, or fails verification against
its own internal checksum, pg_verifybackup will terminate
with a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Second,
pg_verifybackup will attempt to verify that the data files
currently stored on disk are exactly the same as the data
files which the server intended to send, with some
exceptions that are described below. Extra and missing files
will be detected, with a few exceptions. This step will
ignore the presence or absence of, or any modifications to,
postgresql.auto.conf, standby.signal, and recovery.signal,
because it is expected that these files may have been
created or modified as part of the process of taking the
backup. It also won't complain about a backup_manifest file
in the target directory or about anything inside pg_wal,
even though these files won't be listed in the backup
manifest. Only files are checked; the presence or absence of
directories is not verified, except indirectly: if a
directory is missing, any files it should have contained
will necessarily also be missing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next,
pg_verifybackup will checksum all the files, compare the
checksums against the values in the manifest, and emit
errors for any files for which the computed checksum does
not match the checksum stored in the manifest. This step is
not performed for any files which produced errors in the
previous step, since they are already known to have
problems. Files which were ignored in the previous step are
also ignored in this step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
pg_verifybackup will use the manifest to verify that the
write-ahead log records which will be needed to recover the
backup are present and that they can be read and parsed. The
backup_manifest contains information about which write-ahead
log records will be needed, and pg_verifybackup will use
that information to invoke pg_waldump to parse those
write-ahead log records. The --quiet flag will be used, so
that pg_waldump will only report errors, without producing
any other output. While this level of verification is
sufficient to detect obvious problems such as a missing file
or one whose internal checksums do not match, they aren't
extensive enough to detect every possible problem that might
occur when attempting to recover. For instance, a server bug
that produces write-ahead log records that have the correct
checksums but specify nonsensical actions can't be detected
by this method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
extra WAL files which are not required to recover the backup
are present, they will not be checked by this tool, although
a separate invocation of pg_waldump could be used for that
purpose. Also note that WAL verification is
version-specific: you must use the version of
pg_verifybackup, and thus of pg_waldump, which pertains to
the backup being checked. In contrast, the data file
integrity checks should work with any version of the server
that generates a backup_manifest file.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_verifybackup
accepts the following command-line arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-e <br>
--exit-on-error</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exit as soon as a problem with
the backup is detected. If this option is not specified,
pg_verifybackup will continue checking the backup even after
a problem has been detected, and will report all problems
detected as errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-i</b>
<i>path</i> <b><br>
--ignore=</b><i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore the specified file or
directory, which should be expressed as a relative path
name, when comparing the list of data files actually present
in the backup to those listed in the backup_manifest file.
If a directory is specified, this option affects the entire
subtree rooted at that location. Complaints about extra
files, missing files, file size differences, or checksum
mismatches will be suppressed if the relative path name
matches the specified path name. This option can be
specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-m</b>
<i>path</i> <b><br>
--manifest-path=</b><i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the manifest file at the
specified path, rather than one located in the root of the
backup directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-n <br>
--no-parse-wal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don't attempt to parse
write-ahead log data that will be needed to recover from
this backup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-q <br>
--quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don't print anything when a
backup is successfully verified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-s <br>
--skip-checksums</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not verify data file
checksums. The presence or absence of files and the sizes of
those files will still be checked. This is much faster,
because the files themselves do not need to be read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-w</b>
<i>path</i> <b><br>
--wal-directory=</b><i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Try to parse WAL files stored
in the specified directory, rather than in pg_wal. This may
be useful if the backup is stored in a separate location
from the WAL archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other options
are also available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-V <br>
--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print the pg_verifybackup
version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-? <br>
--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show help about pg_verifybackup
command line arguments, and exit.</p>
