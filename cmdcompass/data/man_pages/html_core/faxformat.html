<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page, part
of the <b>Netpbm user&rsquo;s guide</b>(1), describes FAX
formats in relation to Netpbm facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ITU
(formerly CCITT) publishes standards for operation of fax
machines (the idea is to provide a way to be sure that a fax
machine is able to receive a fax sent by another). These
standards incidentally specify graphics file formats -- a
protocol for representing a visual image in sequences of
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two
relevant standards are called Group 3 (G3) and Group 4 (G4)
(Groups 1 and 2 are analog standards no longer in use).
Virtually every fax machine in existence conforms at least
generally to at least one of these standards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
for Group 3 fax is defined in ITU Recommendation T.4. In the
U.S., that is implemented by EIA standards EIA-465 and
EIA-466. These standards cover more than the file format as
well, including how to transmit bits over a telephone line
and procedures for handling document transmissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">G3 faxes are
204 dots per inch (dpi) horizontally and 98 dpi (196 dpi
optionally, in fine-detail mode) vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standards
specify three file formats (also called coding methods and
compression schemes -- remember the standard doesn&rsquo;t
mention computer files; it talks about the format of a
stream of bits travelling over a telephone line):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>MH</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This compresses in one dimension: it compresses
individual raster lines but makes no attempt to compress
redundancy between lines.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">One dimensional
compression is traditionally the best a fax machine could
handle because G3 neither assumes error free transmission
not retransmits when errors occur, and receiving fax
machines traditionally could not afford to buffer much of a
page. It&rsquo;s important that when there is an error in a
raster line, its impact not spread to many lines after
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">All Group 3 and
Group 4 fax machines must be able to send and receive
MH.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MH is sometimes
called &quot;G3,&quot; but that is a poor name because while
the Group 3 standard does specify MH, it has always
specified other formats too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MH is sometimes
called &quot;T4&quot; based on the name of the document that
specifies it, ITU T.4. But this is a poor name because T.4
also specifies MR.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">MR</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This compresses in two
dimensions, horizontally and vertically.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MR has always
been part of the Group 3 standard, but is optional (a Group
3 fax machine may or may not be able to send and receive
it).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMR</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a more advanced format
than the others. It is even more two-dimensional than MR. It
is optional in the Group 3 standard, and didn&rsquo;t even
exist in earlier versions of it. It was developed
specifically for the Group 4 standard, but then added to an
extended Group 3 standard as well.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MMR is
sometimes called Group 4, but that is a poor name because of
the fact that it is also part of the current Group 3
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">MMR is
sometimes called &quot;T6&quot; based on the name of the
document <br>
that specifies it, ITU T.6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>g3topbm</b>
converts the MH format to PBM. <b>pbmtog3</b> converts PBM
to MH.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
Netpbm program to convert to or from other fax formats.</p>

<h2>TIFF
<a name="TIFF"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The TIFF format
is flexible enough to allow lots of different coding
methods, within it. There are TIFF subformats for MH, MR,
and MMR, among others. These are particularly useful when
you receive a fax as a TIFF file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tifftopnm</b>
recognizes and can convert from any of these.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamtotiff</b>
can convert to any of these; you use command options to
choose which.</p>
